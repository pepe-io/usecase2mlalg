{"title": "Real-Time Soft Body Dynamics for Video Games", "description": "We have had plenty of episodes about fluid simulations, so how about some tasty soft body dynamics for today? Soft body dynamics basically means computing what happens when we smash together different deformable objects. Examples include folding sheets, playing around with noodles, or torturing armadillos. I think this is a nice and representative showcase of the immense joys of computer graphics research! Clarification: the 15 ms per frame execution time is a nice ballpark number, but it depends on the scene.
