{"title": "Real-Time Oil Painting on Mobile", "description": "The paper \"Real-Time Oil Painting on Mobile Hardware\" is available here: http://graphics.cs.kuleuven.be/publications/SD2016RTOPOMH/index.html In addition: It is mentioned that mobile devices typically have a lower resolution display than desktop computers. While this is true, a more important limiting factor is screen real estate, and the fact that a resolution of the simulation is significantly lower on a phone given the vast differences in processing power. These are challenging limitations that are difficult to overcome.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SHW1-qKKpY", "tags": [], "kind": "Paper", "host": "youtube.com", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 1, "compete_score": 0, "engagement_score": 0.6739999999999999, "date_project": "2017-04-09 00:00:00", "date_scraped": "2021-02-01 00:00:00", "words": 73, "sentences": 3, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999960278039798", "tags_descriptive": [], "description_lemmatized": "paper realtime oil painting mobile hardware available httpgraphicscskuleuvenbepublicationssd2016rtopomhindexhtml addition mentioned mobile device typically lower resolution display desktop computer true important limiting factor screen real estate fact resolution simulation significantly lower phone given vast difference processing power challenging limitation difficult overcome", "runtime": 0.008}
