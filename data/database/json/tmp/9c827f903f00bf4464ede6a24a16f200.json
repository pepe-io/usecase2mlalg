{"title": "Designing Cities and Furnitures With Machine Learning", "description": "Creating geometry for a computer game or a movie is a very long and arduous task. For instance, if we would like to populate a virtual city with buildings, it would cost a ton of time and money and of course, we would need quite a few artists. This piece of work solves this problem in a very elegant and convenient way: it learns the preference of the user, then creates and recommends a set of solutions that are expected to be desirable. The weapon of choice to accomplish this was Gaussian Process Regression.
