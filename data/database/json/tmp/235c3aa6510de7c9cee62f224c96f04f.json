{"title": "Sound Synthesis for Fluids With Bubbles", "description": "In this work, the authors created a simulator, that shows us not only the motion of a piece of fluid, but the physics of bubbles within as well. This sounds great, but there are two huge problems: one, there are a lot of them, and two, they can undergo all kinds of deformations and topology changes.
