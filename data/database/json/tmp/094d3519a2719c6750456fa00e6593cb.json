{"title": "Biophysical Skin Aging Simulations", "description": "The faithful simulation of human skin is incredibly important both in computer games, the movie industry, and also in medical sciences. The appearance of our face is strongly determined by the underlying structure of our skin. Human skin changes significantly with age. Scientists at the University of Zaragoza came up with a really cool, fully-fledged biophysically-based model that opens up the possibility of simply specifying intuitive parameters like age, gender, skin type, and get, after some processing, a much lighter skin representation ready to generate photorealistic rendered results in real time.
