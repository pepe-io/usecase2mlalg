{"title": "Deep Learning and Cancer Research", "description": "A few quite exciting applications of deep learning in cancer research have appeared recently. This new algorithm can recognize cancer cells by looking at blood samples without introducing any intrusive chemicals in the process. Amazing results ahead. :) The paper \"Deep Learning in Label-free Cell Classification\" is available here: http://www.nature.com/articles/srep21471 The link from Healthline: http://www.healthline.com/health/cancer/ovarian-cancer-facts-statistics-infographic#10 Recommended for you: Two+ Minute Papers - Overfitting and Regularization For Deep Learning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aF9s...", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSWr2ovBvU", "tags": ["Classification", "Recommender", "DL"], "kind": "Paper", "host": "youtube.com", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 1, "compete_score": 0, "engagement_score": 0.651, "date_project": "2016-05-08 00:00:00", "date_scraped": "2021-02-01 00:00:00", "words": 70, "sentences": 4, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999957071122754", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Recommender", "Deep Learning (DL)"], "description_lemmatized": "quite exciting application deep learning cancer research appeared recently new algorithm recognize cancer cell looking blood sample without introducing intrusive chemical process amazing result ahead paper deep learning labelfree cell classification available httpwwwnaturecomarticlessrep21471 link healthline httpwwwhealthlinecomhealthcancerovariancancerfactsstatisticsinfographic10 recommended two minute paper overfitting regularization deep learning httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6af9s", "runtime": 0.011}
