{"title": "3D Printing Auxetic Materials", "description": "In this episode, we shall talk about auxetic materials. Auxetic materials are materials that when stretched, thicken perpendicular to the direction we're stretching them. In other words, instead of thinning, they get fatter when stretched. The paper \"Beyond Developable: Computational Design and Fabrication with Auxetic Materials\" is available here: http://lgg.epfl.ch/publications/2016/BeyondDevelopable/index.php The tendon paper, \"Negative Poissons ratios in tendons: An unexpected mechanical response\" is available here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706115002871 Our previous episode about optimization is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ypV5...", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-xMV3sT3Tw", "tags": [], "kind": "Paper", "host": "youtube.com", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 1, "compete_score": 0, "engagement_score": 0.7525, "date_project": "2016-09-30 00:00:00", "date_scraped": "2021-02-01 00:00:00", "words": 75, "sentences": 4, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999970344220475", "tags_descriptive": [], "description_lemmatized": "episode shall talk auxetic material auxetic material material stretched thicken perpendicular direction stretching word instead thinning get fatter stretched paper beyond developable computational design fabrication auxetic material available httplggepflchpublications2016beyonddevelopableindexphp tendon paper negative poissons ratio tendon unexpected mechanical response available httpwwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiis1742706115002871 previous episode optimization available httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv1ypv5", "runtime": 0.015}
