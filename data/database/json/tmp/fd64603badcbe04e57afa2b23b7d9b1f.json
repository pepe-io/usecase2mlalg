{"title": "3D Printing With Filigree Patterns", "description": "Filigrees are detailed, thin patterns typically found in jewelry, fabrics and ornaments, and as you may imagine, crafting such motifs on objects is incredibly laborious. This project is about leaving out the craftsmen from the equation by choosing a set of target filigree patterns and creating a complex shape out of them that can be easily 3D printed. The challenge lies in grouping and packing up these patterns to fill a surface evenly. Let's see what this piece of work has to say about the problem!
