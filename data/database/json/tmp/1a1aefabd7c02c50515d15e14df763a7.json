{"title": "Neural Programmer-Interpreters Learn To Write Programs", "description": "In machine learning, we usually have a set of problems for which we are looking for solutions. For instance, \"here is an image, please tell me what is seen on it\". Or, \"here is a computer game, please beat level three\". One problem, one solution. In this case, we are not looking for one solution, we are looking for a computer program, an algorithm, that can solve any number of problems of the same kind. It can also learn how to rotate images of different cars around to obtain a frontal pose. This technique can learn from someone how to sort a set of 20 numbers and generalize its knowledge to much longer sequences.
