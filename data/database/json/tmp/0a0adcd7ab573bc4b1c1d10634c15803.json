{"title": "Painting with Fluid Simulations", "description": "As there is a lot of progress in simulating the motion of fluids, and paint is a fluid, then why not simulate the process of painting on a canvas? The simulations with this technique are so detailed that even the bristle interactions are taken into consideration, therefore one can capture artistic brush stroke effects like stabbing. Traditional techniques cannot even come close to simulating such sophisticated effects.
