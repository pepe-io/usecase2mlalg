{"title": "Hallucinating Images With Deep Learning", "description": "During our journeys in deep learning, we have seen techniques that can summarize photographs in entire sentences that actually make sense. This time, we are going to turn this process around and ask a deep learning system to \"hallucinate\", i.e., generate images according to sentences that we add as an input. The results are nothing short of insane!
