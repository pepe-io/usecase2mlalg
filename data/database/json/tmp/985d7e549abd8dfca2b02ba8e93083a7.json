{"title": "3D Printing a Glockenspiel", "description": "Researchers at Harvard, Columbia University and MIT got interested in exploring the sounds that different metal objects emit when struck, opening up the possibility of computationally designing musical instruments such as a glockenspiel. The output of the algorithm is the blueprint of the instrument that can be 3D printed. The sound quality of these instruments is remarkably close to professionally manufactured instruments. The paper \"Computational Design of Metallophone Contact Sounds\" is available below. It also contains a comparison to a professionally manufactured instrument. http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~gaurav/papers/cdmcs sa 2015/ Recommended for you: Hydrographic 3D printing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLnG0...", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kOCTf8jIik", "tags": ["Recommender"], "kind": "Paper", "host": "youtube.com", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 1, "compete_score": 0, "engagement_score": 0.6375, "date_project": "2015-10-17 00:00:00", "date_scraped": "2021-02-01 00:00:00", "words": 94, "sentences": 6, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999968087303835", "tags_descriptive": ["Recommender"], "description_lemmatized": "researcher harvard columbia university mit got interested exploring sound different metal object emit struck opening possibility computationally designing musical instrument glockenspiel output algorithm blueprint instrument 3d printed sound quality instrument remarkably close professionally manufactured instrument paper computational design metallophone contact sound available also contains comparison professionally manufactured instrument httppeopleseasharvardedugauravpaperscdmcs sa 2015 recommended hydrographic 3d printing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvklng0", "runtime": 0.008}
