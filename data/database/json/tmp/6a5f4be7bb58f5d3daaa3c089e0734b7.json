{"title": "3D Printing Materials With Subsurface Scattering", "description": "Better Explained tutorials: https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/ https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/ Today, our main question is whether we can reproduce the effect of subsurface scattering with 3D printed materials. The input would be a real material, and the output would be an arbitrary shaped 3d printed material with similar scattering properties. Something that looks similar.
