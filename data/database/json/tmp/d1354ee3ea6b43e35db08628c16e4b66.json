{"title": "Generating Tangle Patterns With Grammars", "description": "A tangle pattern is a beautiful, intervowen tapestry of basic stroke patterns, like dots, straight lines, and simple curves. If we look at some of these works, we see that many of these are highly structured, and maybe, we could automatically create such beautiful structures with a computer.
