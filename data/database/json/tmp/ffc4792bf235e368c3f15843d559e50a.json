{"title": "Photorealistic Images from Drawings", "description": "The Two Minute Papers subreddit is available here: https://www.reddit.com/r/twominutepapers/ By using a convolutional neural networks (a powerful deep learning technique), it is now possible to build an application that takes a rough sketch as an input, and fetches photorealistic images from a database.
