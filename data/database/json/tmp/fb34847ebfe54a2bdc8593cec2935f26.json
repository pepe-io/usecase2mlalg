{"title": "Training Deep Neural Networks With Dropout", "description": "In this episode, we discuss the bane of many machine learning algorithms - overfitting. It is also explained why it is an undesirable way to learn and how to combat it via dropout. The paper \"Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overtting\" is available here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf Andrej Karpathy's autoencoder is available here: http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/autoencoder.html Recommended for you: Overfitting and Regularization For Deep Learning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aF9s...
