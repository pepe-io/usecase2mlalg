{"title": "Artistic Manipulation of Caustics", "description": "A caustic is a beautiful phenomenon in nature where curved surfaces reflect or refract light, thereby concentrating it to a relatively small area. Since we, humans are pretty bad at estimating how exactly caustics should look like, one can manipulate them to be more in line with their artistic vision.
