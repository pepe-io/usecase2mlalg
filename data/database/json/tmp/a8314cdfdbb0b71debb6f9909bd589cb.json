{"title": "Interactive Photo Recoloring", "description": "Image and color editing is an actively researched topic with really cool applications that you will see in a second. Most of the existing solutions are either easy to use but lack in expressiveness, or they are expressive, but too complex for novices to use. Computation time is also an issue as some of the operations in photoshop can take more than a minute to carry out. Using a naive color transfer technique would destroy a sizeable part of the dynamic range of the input image image, and hence, legitimate features which are all preserved if we use this algorithm instead.
