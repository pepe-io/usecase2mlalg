{"title": "Bundlefusion: 3D Scenes from 2D Videos", "description": "This piece of work enables us to walk around in a room with a camera, and create a complete 3D computer model from the video footage. Note that the title says \"2D\", but since RGB-D cameras are relatively new, they are both referred to as 2D and 3D (I've heard 2.5D as well before). We went with the 2D for now and I hope it won't raise any confusion! :) The paper \"BundleFusion: Real-time Globally Consistent 3D Reconstruction using Online Surface Re-integration\" is available here: http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/bundlefusion/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLzhsyeAie4", "tags": [], "kind": "Paper", "host": "youtube.com", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 1, "compete_score": 0, "engagement_score": 0.6705, "date_project": "2016-07-25 00:00:00", "date_scraped": "2021-02-01 00:00:00", "words": 86, "sentences": 3, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.999997932391946", "tags_descriptive": [], "description_lemmatized": "piece work enables u walk around room camera create complete 3d computer model video footage note title say 2d since rgbd camera relatively new referred 2d 3d ive heard 25d well went 2d hope wont raise confusion paper bundlefusion realtime globally consistent 3d reconstruction using online surface reintegration available httpgraphicsstanfordeduprojectsbundlefusion", "runtime": 0.009}
