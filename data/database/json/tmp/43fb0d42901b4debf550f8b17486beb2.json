{"title": "Deep Reinforcement Terrain Learning", "description": "In this piece of work, a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning is presented which has proven to be useful in solving many extremely difficult tasks. Google DeepMind built a system that can play Atari games at a superhuman level using this technique that is also referred to as Deep Q-Learning. This time, it was used to teach digital creatures to walk and overcome challenging terrain arrangements.
