{"title": "Recurrent Neural Network Writes Music and Shakespeare Novels", "description": "Artificial neural networks are powerful machine learning techniques that can learn to recognize images or paint in the style of Van Gogh. Recurrent neural networks offer a more general model that can learn input sequences and create output sequences. The resulting technique (Long Short-Term Memory in these examples) can write novels in the style of Tolstoy, Shakespeare, or write their own music.
