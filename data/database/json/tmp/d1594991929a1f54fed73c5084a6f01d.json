{"title": "Interactive Hair-Solid Simulations", "description": "We have talked about fluid and cloth simulations earlier, but we never really set foot in the domain of hair simulations in the series. To obtain some footage of virtual hair movement, simulating the dynamics of hundreds of thousands of hair strands is clearly too time consuming and would be a flippant attempt to do so. In this episode, we discuss a technique to faithfully simulate 150 thousand hair strands by using only 400 guide hairs.
