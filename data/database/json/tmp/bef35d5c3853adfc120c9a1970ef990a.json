{"title": "Neural Network Learns The Physics of Fluids and Smoke", "description": "The paper \"Accelerating Eulerian Fluid Simulation With Convolutional Networks\" and its source code is available here: http://cims.nyu.edu/~schlacht/CNNFluids.htm https://users.cg.tuwien.ac.at/zsolnai/accelerating-eulerian-fluid-simulation-convolutional-networks/ https://github.com/google/FluidNet The mentioned previous work has used an SPH-based Lagrangian simulation, performed the regression with regression forests, and the process also has included a fair amount of feature engineering. It is an excellent piece of work by the name \"Data-driven Fluid Simulations using Regression Forests\" and is a highly recommended read: https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/ladickyl/fluid sigasia15.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGB7W...
