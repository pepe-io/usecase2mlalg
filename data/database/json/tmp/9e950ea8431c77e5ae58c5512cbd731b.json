{"title": "Automatic Hair Modeling from One Image", "description": "This time, we are going to talk about hair modeling - obtaining hair geometry information from a photograph. This geometry information we can use in our movies and computer games. We can also run simulations on them and see how they look on a digital character. This is a remarkably difficult problem and you'll see a great solution to it in this episode.
