{"title": "Recurrent Neural Network Writes Sentences About Images", "description": "This technique is a combination of two powerful machine learning algorithms: - convolutional neural networks are excellent at image classification, i.e., finding out what is seen on an input image, - recurrent neural networks that are capable of processing a sequence of inputs and outputs, therefore it can create sentences of what is seen on the image. Combining these two techniques makes it possible for a computer to describe in a sentence what is seen on an input image.
