{"title": "Building Bridges With Flying Machines", "description": "Building architectural elements and buildings with flying machines is a hot research topic. It is a remarkably difficult task, as many of these flying machines not only have to be controlled safely, but they also have to collaborate efficiently to succeed in building complex structures. Even something as mundane as deploying the rope has its own science. In this work from the ETH Zrich, these flying machines build quite reliable rope bridges that humans can use for traversal.
