{"title": "Sound Propagation With Adaptive Impulse Responses", "description": "A realistic simulation of sounds within virtual environments dramatically improves the immersion of the user in computer games and virtual reality applications. To be able to simulate these effects, we need to compute the interaction between sound waves and the geometry and materials within the scene. Let's see how this work accomplishes it!
