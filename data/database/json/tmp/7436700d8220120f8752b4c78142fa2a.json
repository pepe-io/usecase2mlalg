{"title": "Synthesizing Sound From Collisions", "description": "Simulating colliding bodies is an essential part of creating photorealistic video footage on a computer. However, even though we know how these collisions look like, we don't yet know how they sound like. In this piece of work, a technique is described that is capable of simulating the sound emitted by smashing deformable bodies together. The results match real-world experiments remarkably well.
