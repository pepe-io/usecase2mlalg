{"title": "The Dunning-Kruger Effect", "description": "The Dunning-Kruger effect describes a phenomenon where incompetent people assess their skills way higher than it is. We will talk about this phenomenon, its connection to impostor syndrome, and most importantly, why we should not use this knowledge to condemn others but to improve ourselves. The paper \"Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments\" is available here.
