{"title": "One Hot Encoding in Machine Learning", "description": "In machine learning, one hot encoding is a method of quantifying categorical data. Briefly, this method produces a vector of length equal to the number of categories in the dataset. In this article, I will introduce you to the One Hot Encoding Algorithm in Machine Learning.To learn what One Hot Encoding is we first need to go through what Encoding is to understand what One Hot Encoding is. And yes it is one of the most important concepts in Machine Learning. So let\u2019s get started with this task.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Books You Need to Read.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/27/one-hot-encoding-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-27 23:52:36", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 97, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Emergency & Relief", "description_category_score": 0.23314891755580902, "description_category_runtime": 9.3, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9668293595314026, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.878, "category": "Emergency & Relief", "category_score": 0.23314891755580902, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9668293595314026, "runtime_cat": 23.179, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999981573468648", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "machine learning one hot encoding method quantifying categorical data briefly method produce vector length equal number category dataset article introduce one hot encoding algorithm machine learningto learn one hot encoding first need go encoding understand one hot encoding yes one important concept machine learning let get started taskalso read machine learning book need read", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification"]}
