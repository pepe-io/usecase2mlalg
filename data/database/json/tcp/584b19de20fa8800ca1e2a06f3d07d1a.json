{"title": "Earthquake Prediction Model with Machine Learning", "description": "In this article, I will take you through how to create a model for the task of Earthquake Prediction using Machine Learning and the Python programming language. Predicting earthquakes is one of the great unsolved problems in the earth sciences.With the increase in the use of technology, many seismic monitoring stations have increased, so we can use machine learning and other data-driven methods to predict earthquakes.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Full Course for free.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/12/earthquake-prediction-model-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["CV", "ReLu", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-11-12 21:25:09", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 74, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Emergency & Relief", "description_category_score": 0.05279482901096344, "description_category_runtime": 7.119, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9732121825218201, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.898, "category": "Emergency & Relief", "category_score": 0.05279482901096344, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9732121825218201, "runtime_cat": 18.017, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999985720300675", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article take create model task earthquake prediction using machine learning python programming language predicting earthquake one great unsolved problem earth scienceswith increase use technology many seismic monitoring station increased use machine learning datadriven method predict earthquakesalso read machine learning full course free", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)", "Classification"]}
