{"title": "Extracting HOG Features", "description": "In Data Science the HOG (Histogram of Gradients) is a straightforward feature extraction process that was developed with the idea of identifying pedestrians within images. A fast HOG extractor is built into the Scikit-Image project, and we can try it out relatively quickly and visualize the oriented gradients within each cell:", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/05/15/data-science-project-on-extracting-hog-features/", "tags": [], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-15 00:33:31", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 51, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.08350344002246857, "description_category_runtime": 5.701, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.33079567551612854, "description_subcategory_runtime": 8.52, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.08350344002246857, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.33079567551612854, "runtime_cat": 14.221, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "0.7", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999969114248612", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "data science hog histogram gradient straightforward feature extraction process developed idea identifying pedestrian within image fast hog extractor built scikitimage project try relatively quickly visualize oriented gradient within cell", "tags_descriptive": []}
