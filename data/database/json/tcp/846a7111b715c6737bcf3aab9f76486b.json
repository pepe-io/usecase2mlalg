{"title": "Bagging and Pasting in Machine Learning", "description": "In Machine Learning, one way to use the same training algorithm for more prediction models and to train them on different sets of the data is known as Bagging and Pasting. Bagging means to perform sampling with replacement and when the process of bagging is done without replacement then this is known as Pasting.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/31/bagging-and-pasting-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification", "Decision Tree"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-31 23:52:53", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 54, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.11600131541490555, "description_category_runtime": 5.472, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.999471127986908, "description_subcategory_runtime": 8.203, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.11600131541490555, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.999471127986908, "runtime_cat": 13.674, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972790518006", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "machine learning one way use training algorithm prediction model train different set data known bagging pasting bagging mean perform sampling replacement process bagging done without replacement known pasting", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Decision Tree"]}
