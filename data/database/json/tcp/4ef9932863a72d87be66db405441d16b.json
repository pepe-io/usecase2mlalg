{"title": "Summarize Text with Machine Learning", "description": "Text Summarization involves condensing a piece of text into a shorter version, reducing the size of the original text while preserving key information and the meaning of the content. Since manual text synthesis is a long and generally laborious task, task automation is gaining in popularity and therefore a strong motivation for academic research. In this article, I will take you through the task of Natural Language Processing to summarize text with Machine Learning.In Machine Learning, there are important applications for text summarization in various Natural Language Processing related tasks such as text classification, answering questions, legal text synthesis, news synthesis, and headline generation which can be achieved with Machine Learning. The intention to summarize a text is to create an accurate and fluid summary containing only the main points described in the document.Also, Read \u2013 Scraping YouTube with Python.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/24/summarize-text-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Supervised Learning", "NLP", "Classification", "Classification", "Unsupervised Learning"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "nltk"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-24 08:08:43", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 140, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.3509969115257263, "description_category_runtime": 12.028, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8543493747711182, "description_subcategory_runtime": 18.17, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.3509969115257263, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8543493747711182, "runtime_cat": 30.198, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999998007274203", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "text summarization involves condensing piece text shorter version reducing size original text preserving key information meaning content since manual text synthesis long generally laborious task task automation gaining popularity therefore strong motivation academic research article take task natural language processing summarize text machine learningin machine learning important application text summarization various natural language processing related task text classification answering question legal text synthesis news synthesis headline generation achieved machine learning intention summarize text create accurate fluid summary containing main point described documentalso read scraping youtube python", "tags_descriptive": ["Supervised Learning", "Natural Language Processing (NLP)", "Classification", "Classification", "Unsupervised Learning"]}
