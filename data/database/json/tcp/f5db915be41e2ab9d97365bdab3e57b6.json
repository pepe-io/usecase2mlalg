{"title": "Time Series with LSTM in Machine Learning", "description": "Neural networks can be a difficult concept to understand. I think it\u2019s mainly because they can be used for so many different things like classification, identification or just regression. In this article, I will walk you through how to set up a simple way to forecast time series with LSTM model.Before getting started with the coding part to forecast time series with LSTM first let\u2019s go through some of the major concepts involved for all the beginners who are reading this article.Also, Read \u2013 How to Practice Machine Learning?", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/29/time-series-with-lstm-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["LSTM", "RNN", "Regression", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-29 12:55:15", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 89, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.01, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.27714550495147705, "description_category_runtime": 8.532, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7291201949119568, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.823, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.27714550495147705, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7291201949119568, "runtime_cat": 21.355, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972667442497", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "neural network difficult concept understand think mainly used many different thing like classification identification regression article walk set simple way forecast time series lstm modelbefore getting started coding part forecast time series lstm first let go major concept involved beginner reading articlealso read practice machine learning", "tags_descriptive": ["Long short-term memory (LSTM)", "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)", "Regression", "Classification"]}
