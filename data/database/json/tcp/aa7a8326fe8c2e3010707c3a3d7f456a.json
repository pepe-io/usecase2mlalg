{"title": "When Do We Need Machine Learning?", "description": "In this article, I will introduce you to a very important concept for machine learning practitioners: when do we need machine learning. It\u2019s one of those basic issues that every computer science student faces when moving from basic computing practices to machine learning.If you are one of those people who does not know when we should use programming and when do we use machine learning algorithms, I hope by the end of this article you will understand all about when do we use machine learning.Also, Read \u2013 Predict Car Prices with Machine Learning.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/21/when-do-we-need-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Speech Recognition"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-21 12:11:52", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 93, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.0789513811469078, "description_category_runtime": 8.202, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8495431542396545, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.776, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.0789513811469078, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8495431542396545, "runtime_cat": 20.978, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967297934874", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article introduce important concept machine learning practitioner need machine learning one basic issue every computer science student face moving basic computing practice machine learningif one people know use programming use machine learning algorithm hope end article understand use machine learningalso read predict car price machine learning", "tags_descriptive": ["Speech Recognition"]}
