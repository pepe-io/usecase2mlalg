{"title": "Outlier Detection with Python", "description": "In this article, I will walk you through the task of outlier detection in machine learning. An outlier is a terminology commonly used by analysts and data scientists because it requires special attention, otherwise, it can lead to totally wrong estimates. Simply put, outlier detection is an observation that appears far away from and diverges from an overall pattern in a sample.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Full Course for free.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/12/outlier-detection-with-python/", "tags": ["GRU"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-11-12 00:04:30", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 70, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.13326117396354675, "description_category_runtime": 7.187, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9830016493797302, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.779, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.13326117396354675, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9830016493797302, "runtime_cat": 17.966, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999983645430089", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article walk task outlier detection machine learning outlier terminology commonly used analyst data scientist requires special attention otherwise lead totally wrong estimate simply put outlier detection observation appears far away diverges overall pattern samplealso read machine learning full course free", "tags_descriptive": ["Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)"]}
