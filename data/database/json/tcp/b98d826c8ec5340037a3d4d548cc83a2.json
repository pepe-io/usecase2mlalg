{"title": "Visualize a Decision Tree in Machine Learning", "description": "In Machine Learning, a decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a graphical or tree model of decisions and their possible consequences, including the results of random events, resource costs, and utility. This is a way of displaying an algorithm that contains only conditional control statements. In this article, I will take you through how we can visualize a decision tree using Python.Visualizing a Decision tree is very much different from the visualization of data where we have used a decision tree algorithm. So, If you are not very much familiar with the decision tree algorithm then I will recommend you to first go through the decision tree algorithm from here.Also, Read \u2013 Visualize Real-Time Stock Prices with Python.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/22/visualize-a-decision-tree-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Recommender", "Decision Tree", "Chatbot", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-22 21:17:10", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 121, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.24352920055389404, "description_category_runtime": 10.353, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8643127679824829, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.743, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.24352920055389404, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8643127679824829, "runtime_cat": 26.097, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999970999922895", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "machine learning decision tree decision support tool us graphical tree model decision possible consequence including result random event resource cost utility way displaying algorithm contains conditional control statement article take visualize decision tree using pythonvisualizing decision tree much different visualization data used decision tree algorithm much familiar decision tree algorithm recommend first go decision tree algorithm herealso read visualize realtime stock price python", "tags_descriptive": ["Recommender", "Decision Tree", "Chatbot", "Classification"]}
