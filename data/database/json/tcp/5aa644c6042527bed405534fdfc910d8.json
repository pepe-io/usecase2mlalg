{"title": "NLP For WhatsApp Chats", "description": "Natural Language Processing or NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence which focuses on enabling the systems for understanding and processing the human languages. In this article, I will use NLP to analyze my WhatsApp Chats. For some privacy reasons, I will use Person 1, Person 2 and so on in my WhatsApp Chats.If you have never exported your whatsapp chats before, don\u2019t worry it\u2019s very easy. For NLP of WhatsApp chats, you need to extract the whatsapp chats from your smartphone. You just need to open any chat in your whatsapp then select the export chat option. The text file you will get as a return will look like this:I will use two different approaches for the NLP of WhatsApp Chats. First, by focusing on the fundamentals of NLP and the other is by using the datetime stamp at the starting of every conversation.To analyze our whatsapp conversations, initially, our conversation needs to be formatted in the form of data. This involved a few basic steps in achieving the formation of data by creating a dictionary, constructed within two keys with each of the respective values with a list of the person tokenized conversations.The classification of tokenized conversations will ne be achieved by training a Naive Bayes Classification model or the training set with some pre-categorized chat styles conversations:Our trained model can be tested by using a test set or even by user input. Our model is trained in a way that can classify any tokenized sentence into different categories like Greetings, Statements, Emotions, questions, etc.\u2018Greet\u2019ynQuestion\u2019Now let\u2019s run the model on WhatsApp data for counting the occurrences of each category of the tokenized conversations:We all use emojis, everyone, not only on WhatsApp but with any other chatting platform. Now let\u2019s see what emojis are being used in most of the conversations.It\u2019s very interesting to visualize how one person uses more emojis than the other person. This is the only way we express our emotions while having a whatsapp conversation.The plotting of sentiments against the datetime is not as easy as it looks. As there are many different sentiments on the same day, so the first step is to calculate the mean sentiment for each day and then grouping by datetime. So let\u2019s see how we can do this:Even plotting the average of sentiments for each day will prove to be very messy. So let\u2019s simply take a rolling average of 10 days, and then plot the average sentiment score:Now let\u2019s have a look at the frequency of whatsapp chats which is not a part of NLP for Whatsapp but it is a part of time series analysis. We can use time series here to see the frequency of chats. First, need to create a colour pallete ordered by the total number of messages for each day.Ordered list of days according to total message countThis is essentially the current order of colours:Reorder colours according to their index position in the \u2018days_freq\u2019 list:I hope you liked this article on NLP for WhatsApp chats.
