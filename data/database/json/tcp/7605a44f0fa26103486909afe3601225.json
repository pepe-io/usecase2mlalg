{"title": "Deploy a Machine Learning Model", "description": "I have trained and developed a lot of Machine Learning models, if you are a student in Machine Learning, you must have also developed models. In this article, I will train and Deploy a Machine Learning Model using Flask step by step. I will first train a model, then I will work to serve our model, and at the end I will deploy our machine learning model.When you train a machine learning model, also think about how you will deploy a machine learning model to serve your trained model to the available users. You will get a lot of websites who are teaching to train a machine learning model but nobody goes beyond to deploy a machine learning model. Because training and deploying a machine learning model are very different from each other. But it\u2019s not difficult. Training a model is the most important part in machine learning. But deploying a model is a different art because you have to think  a lot in the process how you will make your machine learning application to your users. Let\u2019s do this step by step. I will train a SMS Spam detection machine learning model. I will not explain the procedure of training a machine learning model as you will get a lot of articles in this website about training model. My primary focus for today is to teach you how to deploy a machine learning model.You can download the dataset I will use in training my machine learning model below:Now let\u2019s train our model for sms spam detection:After you train your model, you must have wondered how could you use that model without training the model. So you can save the model for you future use, there is no need of training the model every time while you the model. You can save your machine learning model as follows:And the next time you need the same model, you can load this machine learning model as follows:After training your sms spam detection classification, it\u2019s time to deploy our machine learning model. I will create a simple web application which will consist a web page which will look like a form where we can write or paste our sms. The web page will consist a submit button, when we will click the submit button it will use our machine learning model to classify whether the sms is spam or ham (not spam).First, I will create a folder for this project called\u00a0SMS-Message-Spam-Detector\u00a0, this is the directory tree inside the folder:The sub-directory\u00a0templates\u00a0is the directory in which Flask will look for static HTML files for rendering in the web browser, in our case, we have two html files:\u00a0home.html\u00a0and\u00a0result.html.The app.py file will contain the main code that will be executed by the python to run our Flask web application. It includes the Machine Learning code for classifying our sms messages as spam or ham.The following are the contents of the\u00a0home.html\u00a0file that will create a text form where a user can enter a message:In the header section of\u00a0or html file (home.html), we loaded\u00a0style.css file. CSS is to determine the appearance and style of HTML documents.\u00a0style.css\u00a0has to be saved in a sub-directory called static, which is the default directory where Flask looks for static files such as CSS.Now, I will create a result.html file that will give us a result of our model prediction. It is the final step when we deploy a machine learning model.After following all the steps to deploy a machine learning model, now you can simply run this program using your app.py file.You will see you output as follows:I hope, you like this article on Train and deploy a machine learning model.
