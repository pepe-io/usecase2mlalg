{"title": "Difference Between Algorithm and Model in Machine Learning", "description": "A very common confusion among those new to machine learning is the difference between a machine learning algorithm and a Model in machine learning. The two terms are often used interchangeably, which makes it even more confusing. So in this article, I will tell you what is the difference between algorithm and model in machine learning.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/27/difference-between-algorithm-and-model-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Regression", "Linear Regression", "Decision Tree", "Logistic Regression", "Clustering", "K-means", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-27 09:03:00", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 56, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.15042589604854584, "description_category_runtime": 5.467, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.935576319694519, "description_subcategory_runtime": 8.132, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.15042589604854584, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.935576319694519, "runtime_cat": 13.6, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999981607006282", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "common confusion among new machine learning difference machine learning algorithm model machine learning two term often used interchangeably make even confusing article tell difference algorithm model machine learning", "tags_descriptive": ["Regression", "Linear Regression", "Decision Tree", "Logistic Regression", "Clustering", "K-means", "Classification"]}
