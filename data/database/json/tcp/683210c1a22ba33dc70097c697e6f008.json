{"title": "Machine Learning for Healthcare", "description": "Electronically stored medical imaging data is plentiful and Machine Learning algorithms can be fed with this type of dataset, to detect and uncover patterns and anomalies. In this article, I will introduce you to five machine learning projects for healthcare.Machines and algorithms can interpret imaging data just as a highly trained radiologist could identify suspicious spots on the skin, lesions, tumours and bleeding in the brain. The use of machine learning tools and platforms to help radiologists is therefore poised to grow exponentially.Also, Read \u2013 Analyze Call Records with Machine Learning using Google Cloud Platform.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/19/machine-learning-for-healthcare/", "tags": ["CNN", "Image Segmentation", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-19 14:37:52", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 95, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.9275866150856018, "description_category_runtime": 8.649, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9627414345741272, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.132, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.9275866150856018, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9627414345741272, "runtime_cat": 21.782, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974492528564", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "electronically stored medical imaging data plentiful machine learning algorithm fed type dataset detect uncover pattern anomaly article introduce five machine learning project healthcaremachines algorithm interpret imaging data highly trained radiologist could identify suspicious spot skin lesion tumour bleeding brain use machine learning tool platform help radiologist therefore poised grow exponentiallyalso read analyze call record machine learning using google cloud platform", "tags_descriptive": ["Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)", "Image Segmentation", "Classification"]}
