{"title": "Covid-19 Cases Prediction with Python", "description": "In this article, I will introduce you to a machine learning project on Covid-19 cases prediction with Python for the next 30 days. These types of predictive models help in providing an accurate prediction of epidemics, which is essential for obtaining information on the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases.Governments and other legislative bodies rely on these kinds of machine learning predictive models and ideas to suggest new policies and assess the effectiveness of applied policies.Also, Read \u2013 100+ Machine Learning Projects Solved and Explained.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/29/covid-19-cases-prediction-with-python/", "tags": [], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-11-29 13:45:18", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 86, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.14068111777305603, "description_category_runtime": 7.981, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9875113368034363, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.368, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.14068111777305603, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9875113368034363, "runtime_cat": 20.349, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999952725236991", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article introduce machine learning project covid19 case prediction python next 30 day type predictive model help providing accurate prediction epidemic essential obtaining information likely spread consequence infectious diseasesgovernments legislative body rely kind machine learning predictive model idea suggest new policy ass effectiveness applied policiesalso read 100 machine learning project solved explained", "tags_descriptive": []}
