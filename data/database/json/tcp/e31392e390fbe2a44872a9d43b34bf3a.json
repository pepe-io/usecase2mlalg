{"title": "AdaBoost Algorithm", "description": "AdaBoost Algorithm is a boosting method that works by combining weak learners into strong learners. A good way for a prediction model to correct its predecessor is to give more attention to the training samples where the predecessor did not fit well. This can result in a new prediction model which will focus much on the hard instances. This technique is used by an AdaBoost Algorithm. In this article, I will take you through the AdaBoost Algorithm in Machine Learning.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/06/adaboost-algorithm/", "tags": ["Classification", "Decision Tree"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-06 17:12:41", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 80, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.28235670924186707, "description_category_runtime": 7.413, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9949174523353577, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.327, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.28235670924186707, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9949174523353577, "runtime_cat": 18.74, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977335742564", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "adaboost algorithm boosting method work combining weak learner strong learner good way prediction model correct predecessor give attention training sample predecessor fit well result new prediction model focus much hard instance technique used adaboost algorithm article take adaboost algorithm machine learning", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Decision Tree"]}
