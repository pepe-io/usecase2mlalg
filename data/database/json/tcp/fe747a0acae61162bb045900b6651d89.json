{"title": "Voting Classifier in Machine Learning", "description": "Suppose you have trained a lot of classification models, and your each model is achieving the accuracy of 85 percent. A very simple way to create an even better classifier is to aggregate the predictions of each classifier and predict the class that gets the most votes. This majority-vote classification is known as a voting classifier.In this article, I will take you through the voting classifier in Machine Learning. I will first start with importing the necessary libraries:", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/31/voting-classifier-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-31 00:44:52", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 78, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.33067837357521057, "description_category_runtime": 7.462, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9986295104026794, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.48, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.33067837357521057, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9986295104026794, "runtime_cat": 18.942, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999957794589889", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "suppose trained lot classification model model achieving accuracy 85 percent simple way create even better classifier aggregate prediction classifier predict class get vote majorityvote classification known voting classifierin article take voting classifier machine learning first start importing necessary library", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Regression"]}
