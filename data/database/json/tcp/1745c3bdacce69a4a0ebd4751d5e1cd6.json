{"title": "Sign Language Classification with Python", "description": "In this article, I will introduce you to a machine learning project on sign language classification with Python. Sign language is a visual way of communicating through hand signals, gestures, facial expressions, and body language.Sign language is the primary form of communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community, but sign language can be useful for other groups of people as well. People with disabilities, including autism, apraxia of speech, cerebral palsy, and Down syndrome, may also find sign language beneficial for communication.Also, Read \u2013 100+ Machine Learning Projects Solved and Explained.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/12/05/sign-language-classification-with-python/", "tags": ["Classification", "ReLu"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn", "tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-12-05 12:25:55", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 93, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.06497254967689514, "description_category_runtime": 8.929, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9808937311172485, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.502, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.06497254967689514, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9808937311172485, "runtime_cat": 22.431, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965234848255", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article introduce machine learning project sign language classification python sign language visual way communicating hand signal gesture facial expression body languagesign language primary form communication deaf hard hearing community sign language useful group people well people disability including autism apraxia speech cerebral palsy syndrome may also find sign language beneficial communicationalso read 100 machine learning project solved explained", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)"]}
