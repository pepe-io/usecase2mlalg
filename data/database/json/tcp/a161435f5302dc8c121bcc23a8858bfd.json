{"title": "Audio Feature Extraction", "description": "Audio Feature Extraction has been one of the significant focus of Machine Learning over the years. The most frequent common state of data is a text where we can perform feature extraction quite smoothly. Then we have Feature Extraction for the image, which is a challenging task. Now I will show you Audio Feature Extraction, which is a bit more complicated task in Machine Learning. Feature Extraction is the process of reducing the number of features in the data by creating new features using the existing ones. The new extracted features must be able to summarise most of the information contained in the original set of elements in the data.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/28/audio-feature-extraction/", "tags": ["K-means", "Clustering", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-28 08:14:08", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 110, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "description_category_score": 0.020330604165792465, "description_category_runtime": 9.305, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9568281769752502, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.523, "category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "category_score": 0.020330604165792465, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9568281769752502, "runtime_cat": 23.827, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999981927522648", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "audio feature extraction one significant focus machine learning year frequent common state data text perform feature extraction quite smoothly feature extraction image challenging task show audio feature extraction bit complicated task machine learning feature extraction process reducing number feature data creating new feature using existing one new extracted feature must able summarise information contained original set element data", "tags_descriptive": ["K-means", "Clustering", "Regression"]}
