{"title": "OpenAI Gym in Machine Learning", "description": "OpenAI Gym is a toolkit that provides a wide variety of simulated environments (Atari games, board games, 2D and 3D physical simulations, and so on), so you can train agents, compare them, or develop new Machine Learning algorithms (Reinforcement Learning). OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research company, funded in part by Elon Musk. Its stated goal is to promote and develop friendly AIs that will benefit humanity (rather than exterminate it).", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/26/openai-gym-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["CNN", "RL"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn", "tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-26 01:09:34", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 71, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.4473986029624939, "description_category_runtime": 7.404, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8847599625587463, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.562, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.4473986029624939, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8847599625587463, "runtime_cat": 18.967, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977164203457", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "openai gym toolkit provides wide variety simulated environment atari game board game 2d 3d physical simulation train agent compare develop new machine learning algorithm reinforcement learning openai artificial intelligence research company funded part elon musk stated goal promote develop friendly ai benefit humanity rather exterminate", "tags_descriptive": ["Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)", "Reinforcement Learning (RL)"]}
