{"title": "Grid Search for Model Tuning", "description": "In this article, I will take you through a very powerful algorithm in Machine Learning, which is the Grid Search Algorithm. It is mostly used in hyperparameters tuning and models selection in Machine Learning. Here I will teach you how to implement this algorithm using python. At the end of this article, you will learn how to apply it in a real-life problem and how to choose the most effective hyperparameters for our Machine Learning model for great accuracy.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/17/grid-search-for-model-tuning/", "tags": ["CV", "DL", "ReLu", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-17 10:54:51", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 79, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.16311398148536682, "description_category_runtime": 7.383, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9883918166160583, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.44, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.16311398148536682, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9883918166160583, "runtime_cat": 18.824, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999962594536859", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article take powerful algorithm machine learning grid search algorithm mostly used hyperparameters tuning model selection machine learning teach implement algorithm using python end article learn apply reallife problem choose effective hyperparameters machine learning model great accuracy", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)", "Classification"]}
