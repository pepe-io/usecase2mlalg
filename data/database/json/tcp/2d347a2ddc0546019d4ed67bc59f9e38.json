{"title": "Employee Turnover Prediction", "description": "This article features the implementation of an employee turnover analysis that is built using Python\u2019s Scikit-Learn library. In this article, I will use Logistic Regression and  Random Forest Machine Learning algorithms. At the end of this article, you would be able to choose the best algorithm for your future projects like Employee Turnover Prediction.Employee Turnover or Employee Turnover ratio is the measurement of the total number of employees who leave an organization in a particular year. Employee Turnover Prediction means to predict whether an employee is going to leave the organization in the coming period. A Company uses this predictive analysis to measure how many employees they will need if the potential employees will leave their organization. A company also uses this predictive analysis to make the workplace better for employees by understanding the core reasons for the high turnover ratio.Now let\u2019s dive into the data to move further with this project on Employee Turnover Prediction. You can download the dataset I have used in this article below.Now let\u2019s import the data and move further with the analysis:Rename column name from \u201csales\u201d to \u201cdepartment\u201d:The type of the columns can be found out as follows:Our data is pretty clean, with no missing values, so let\u2019s move further and see how many employees work in the organization:The \u201cleft\u201d column is the outcome variable recording one and 0. 1 for employees who left the company and 0 for those who didn\u2019t.The department column of the dataset has many categories, and we need to reduce the categories for better modelling. Let\u2019s see all the categories of the department column:Let\u2019s add all the \u201ctechnical\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d and \u201cIT\u201d columns into one column to make our analysis easier.As there are two categorical variables (department, salary) in the dataset and they need to be converted to dummy variables before they can be used for modelling.Now the actual variables need to be removed after the dummy variable have been created. Column names after creating dummy variables for categorical variables:The outcome variable is \u201cleft\u201d, and all the other variables are predictors.Let\u2019s use the feature selection method to decide which variables are the best option that can predict employee turnover with great accuracy. There are a total of 18 columns in X, and now let\u2019s see how we can select about 10 from them:You can see that or feature selection chose the 10 variables for us, which are marked True in the\u00a0support_\u00a0array and marked with a choice \u201c1\u201d in the\u00a0ranking_array. Now lets have a look at these columns:Let\u2019s check the accuracy of our logistic regression model.Now let\u2019s check the accuracy of our Random Forest Classification Model: Random Forest Accuracy: 0.978Now I will construct a confusion matrix to visualize predictions made by our classifier and evaluate the accuracy of our machine learning classification.Random ForestLogistic RegressionThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC)\u00a0curve is a standard tool used with binary classifiers. The red dotted line represents the ROC curve of a purely random classifier; a good classifier stays as far away from that line as possible (toward the top-left corner).So, as we can see that the Random Forest Model has proven to be more useful in the prediction of employee turnover, now let\u2019s have a look at the feature importance of our random forest classification model.According to our Random Forest classification model, the above aspects show the most important features which will influence whether an employee will leave the company, in ascending order.I hope you liked this article on Employee Turnover Prediction with Machine Learning.
