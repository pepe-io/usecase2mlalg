{"title": "Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Data with Machine Learning", "description": "Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of data recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined Human activities.It is a challenging problem as the large number of observations are produced each second, the temporal nature of the observations, and the lack of a clear way to relate data to known movements increase the challenges.In this Machine Learning Project, we will create a model for recognition of  human activity using  the smartphone data.Let\u2019s start with Importing necessary librariesTo Combine\u00a0both the \u00a0data frames#Output((7352, 564), (2947, 564))Test\u00a0options\u00a0and\u00a0evaluation\u00a0metric", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/05/27/human-activity-recognition-using-smartphone-data-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-27 02:02:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 91, "sentences": 1, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.26747703552246094, "description_category_runtime": 10.005, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9848321080207825, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.667, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.26747703552246094, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9848321080207825, "runtime_cat": 25.673, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999996933700749", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "human activity recognition problem classifying sequence data recorded specialized harness smart phone known welldefined human activitiesit challenging problem large number observation produced second temporal nature observation lack clear way relate data known movement increase challengesin machine learning project create model recognition human activity using smartphone datalets start importing necessary librariesto combine data framesoutput7352 564 2947 564test option evaluation metric", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification"]}
