{"title": "Decision Boundary in Machine Learning", "description": "The general goal of a classification model is to find a decision boundary. The purpose of the decision boundaries is to identify those regions of the input class space that corresponds to each class. In this article, I will take you through the concept of decision boundary in machine learning.To explain the concept of decision boundaries in machine learning, I will first create a Logistic Regression model. So now let\u2019s import some libraries and get started with the task:", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/29/decision-boundary-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Regression", "Linear Regression", "Anomaly Detection", "Logistic Regression", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-29 23:06:20", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 79, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.2912617623806, "description_category_runtime": 7.393, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9635977745056152, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.476, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.2912617623806, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9635977745056152, "runtime_cat": 18.87, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999988104511949", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general goal classification model find decision boundary purpose decision boundary identify region input class space corresponds class article take concept decision boundary machine learningto explain concept decision boundary machine learning first create logistic regression model let import library get started task", "tags_descriptive": ["Regression", "Linear Regression", "Anomaly Detection", "Logistic Regression", "Classification"]}
