{"title": "Hate Speech Detection Model", "description": "The term hate speech is understood as any type of verbal, written or behavioural communication that attacks or uses derogatory or discriminatory language against a person or group based on what they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, ancestry, sex or another identity factor. In this article, I will take you through a hate speech detection model with Machine Learning and Python.Hate Speech Detection is generally a task of sentiment classification. So for training, a model that can classify hate speech from a certain piece of text can be achieved by training it on a data that is generally used to classify sentiments. So for the task of hate speech detection model, I will use the Twitter data.Also, Read \u2013 Linear Regression with PyTorch.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/19/hate-speech-detection-model/", "tags": ["Linear Regression", "Classification", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-19 16:54:44", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 130, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "description_category_score": 0.18133549392223358, "description_category_runtime": 11.307, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.989947497844696, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.259, "category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "category_score": 0.18133549392223358, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.989947497844696, "runtime_cat": 28.566, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968781104859", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "term hate speech understood type verbal written behavioural communication attack us derogatory discriminatory language person group based word based religion ethnicity nationality race colour ancestry sex another identity factor article take hate speech detection model machine learning pythonhate speech detection generally task sentiment classification training model classify hate speech certain piece text achieved training data generally used classify sentiment task hate speech detection model use twitter dataalso read linear regression pytorch", "tags_descriptive": ["Linear Regression", "Classification", "Regression"]}
