{"title": "Image Segmentation", "description": "Being a practitioner in Machine Learning, you must have gone through an image classification, where the goal is to assign a label or a class to the input image. Now, suppose you want to get where the object is present inside the image, the shape of the object, or what pixel represents what object. In such a case, you have to play with the segment of the image, from which I mean to say to give a label to each pixel of the image. The goal of Image Segmentation is to train a Neural Network which can return a pixel-wise mask of the image.In the real world, Image Segmentation helps in many applications in medical science, self-driven cars, imaging of satellites and many more. Image Segmentation works by studying the image at the lowest level. In this article, I will take you through Image Segmentation with Deep Learning. Now let\u2019s learn about Image Segmentation by digging deeper into it. I will start by merely importing the libraries that we need for Image Segmentation.I will use the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset, that is already included in Tensorflow:The code below performs a simple image augmentation. Like we prepare the data before doing any machine learning task based on text analysis. Here I am just preparing the images for Image Segmentation:In the dataset, we already have the required number of training and test sets. So I will continue to use that split of training and test sets:Now let\u2019s have a quick look at an image and it\u2019s mask from the data:", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/22/image-segmentation/", "tags": ["DL", "ANN", "ReLu", "Image Segmentation", "Image2Image", "U-Net", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-22 00:39:06", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 257, "sentences": 11, "sum_nltk": "Being a practitioner in Machine Learning, you must have gone through an image classification, where the goal is to assign a label or a class to the input image.\nIn such a case, you have to play with the segment of the image, from which I mean to say to give a label to each pixel of the image.\nThe goal of Image Segmentation is to train a Neural Network which can return a pixel-wise mask of the image.In the real world, Image Segmentation helps in many applications in medical science, self-driven cars, imaging of satellites and many more.\nIn this article, I will take you through Image Segmentation with Deep Learning.\nNow let\u2019s learn about Image Segmentation by digging deeper into it.\nLike we prepare the data before doing any machine learning task based on text analysis.\nHere I am just preparing the images for Image Segmentation:In the dataset, we already have the required number of training and test sets.\nSo I will continue to use that split of training and test sets:Now let\u2019s have a quick look at an image and it\u2019s mask from the data:", "sum_nltk_words": 181, "sum_nltk_runtime": 0.003, "sum_t5": "image segmentation is a machine learning technique that trains a neural network. it is used to train a neural network which can return a pixel-wise mask of the image. image segmentation helps in many applications in medical science, self-driven cars, imaging of satellites and many more. the code below performs a simple image augmentation. if you want to get the shape of an object, you have to play with the segment of the image.", "sum_t5_words": 74, "sum_t5_runtime": 5.758, "runtime": 0.003, "nltk_category": "Utilities", "nltk_category_score": 0.21928472816944122, "nltk_category_runtime": 16.367, "nltk_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "nltk_subcategory_score": 0.8404783606529236, "nltk_subcategory_runtime": 26.396, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.21928472816944122, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8404783606529236, "runtime_cat": 42.763, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984224525045", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "practitioner machine learning must gone image classification goal assign label class input image suppose want get object present inside image shape object pixel represents object case play segment image mean say give label pixel image goal image segmentation train neural network return pixelwise mask imagein real world image segmentation help many application medical science selfdriven car imaging satellite many image segmentation work studying image lowest level article take image segmentation deep learning let learn image segmentation digging deeper start merely importing library need image segmentationi use oxfordiiit pet dataset already included tensorflowthe code performs simple image augmentation like prepare data machine learning task based text analysis preparing image image segmentationin dataset already required number training test set continue use split training test setsnow let quick look image mask data", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Artificial Neural Network (ANN)", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)", "Image Segmentation", "Image2Image", "U-Net", "Classification"]}
