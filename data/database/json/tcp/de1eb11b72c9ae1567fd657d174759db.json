{"title": "Types of Machine Learning Algorithms", "description": "Machine learning algorithms are a set of instructions for a computer on how to interact with, manipulate, and transform data. There are so many types of machine learning algorithms. Selecting the right algorithm is both science and art.Two data scientists tasked with solving the same business challenge can choose different algorithms to address the same problem. However, understanding different classes of machine learning algorithms helps data scientists identify the best types of algorithms. In this article, I will introduce you to the main types of machine learning algorithms.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Full Course For free.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/02/types-of-machine-learning-algorithms/", "tags": ["CV", "Regression", "DL", "Supervised Learning", "Decision Tree", "Bayesian", "Clustering", "Unsupervised Learning"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-11-02 13:20:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 96, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.2779502868652344, "description_category_runtime": 8.646, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9068191647529602, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.779, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.2779502868652344, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9068191647529602, "runtime_cat": 21.425, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997422843125", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "machine learning algorithm set instruction computer interact manipulate transform data many type machine learning algorithm selecting right algorithm science arttwo data scientist tasked solving business challenge choose different algorithm address problem however understanding different class machine learning algorithm help data scientist identify best type algorithm article introduce main type machine learning algorithmsalso read machine learning full course free", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)", "Regression", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Supervised Learning", "Decision Tree", "Bayesian", "Clustering", "Unsupervised Learning"]}
