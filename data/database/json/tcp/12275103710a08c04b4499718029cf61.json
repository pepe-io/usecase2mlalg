{"title": "Object Detection with Deep Learning using Yolo and Tensorflow", "description": "Yolo is a deep learning algorithm that uses convolutional neural networks for object detection. So what\u2019s great about object detection? In comparison to recognition algorithms, a detection algorithm does not only predict class labels, but detects locations of objects as well.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/06/12/object-detection-with-deep-learning-using-yolo-and-tensorflow/", "tags": ["ResNet", "Regression", "DL", "Object Detection", "CNN", "ReLu", "Clustering", "K-means"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["Pillow", "tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-06-12 15:36:15", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 41, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Manufacturing", "description_category_score": 0.22780314087867737, "description_category_runtime": 4.805, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9846535921096802, "description_subcategory_runtime": 7.377, "category": "Manufacturing", "category_score": 0.22780314087867737, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9846535921096802, "runtime_cat": 12.182, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999986952871763", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "yolo deep learning algorithm us convolutional neural network object detection whats great object detection comparison recognition algorithm detection algorithm predict class label detects location object well", "tags_descriptive": ["ResNet", "Regression", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Object Detection", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)", "Clustering", "K-means"]}
