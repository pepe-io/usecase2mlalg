{"title": "Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis -Binary Classification with Machine Learning", "description": "In this Machine Learning Project, we\u2019ll build  binary classification that puts movie reviews texts into one of two categories \u2014 negative or positive sentiment. We\u2019re going to have a brief look at the Bayes theorem and relax its requirements using the Naive assumption.Let\u2019s start by importing the LibrariesYou can download the data set you need for this task from here:No null values, Label encode sentiment to 1(positive) and 0(negative)", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/05/25/movie-reviews-sentiment-analysis-binary-classification-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "vocabulary", "nltk"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-25 20:53:24", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 70, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Media & Publishing", "description_category_score": 0.22830212116241455, "description_category_runtime": 7.587, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9963716268539429, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.589, "category": "Media & Publishing", "category_score": 0.22830212116241455, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9963716268539429, "runtime_cat": 19.176, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999982132713028", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "machine learning project well build binary classification put movie review text one two category negative positive sentiment going brief look bayes theorem relax requirement using naive assumptionlets start importing librariesyou download data set need task hereno null value label encode sentiment 1positive 0negative", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification"]}
