{"title": "Predict Customer Churn with Python and Machine Learning", "description": "In this project we will be building a model that Predicts customer churn with Machine Learning. We do this by implementing a predictive model with the help of python.Prediction of Customer Churn means our beloved customers with the intention of leaving us in the future.Let\u2019s Start by Importing the required LibrariesLet\u2019s read and look at the dataTo\u00a0show\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0rows\u00a0and\u00a0columns#Output(7043, 21)To see all column namesTo\u00a0check\u00a0for\u00a0NA\u00a0or\u00a0missing\u00a0valuesTo\u00a0show\u00a0some\u00a0statisticsTo get Customer Churn countTo see the percentage of customers that are leavingTo remove\u00a0unnecessary\u00a0columnsTo\u00a0show\u00a0the\u00a0data\u00a0typesTo show\u00a0first\u00a05\u00a0rows\u00a0of\u00a0the new\u00a0data", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/05/26/predict-customer-churn-with-python-and-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-26 17:29:11", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 77, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.2833517789840698, "description_category_runtime": 12.204, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9953184723854065, "description_subcategory_runtime": 18.846, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.2833517789840698, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9953184723854065, "runtime_cat": 31.051, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999966962189947", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "project building model predicts customer churn machine learning implementing predictive model help pythonprediction customer churn mean beloved customer intention leaving u futurelets start importing required librarieslets read look datato show number row columnsoutput7043 21to see column namesto check na missing valuesto show statisticsto get customer churn countto see percentage customer leavingto remove unnecessary columnsto show data typesto show first 5 row new data", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Regression"]}
