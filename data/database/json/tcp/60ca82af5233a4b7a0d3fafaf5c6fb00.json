{"title": "Fake Currency Detection with Machine Learning", "description": "Fake Currency Detection is a real problem for both individuals and businesses. Counterfeiters are constantly finding new methods and techniques to produce counterfeit banknotes, which are essentially indistinguishable from real money. At least for the human eye. In this article, I will introduce you to Fake Currency Detection with Machine Learning.Fake Currency Detection is a task of binary classification in machine learning. If we have enough data on real and fake banknotes, we can use that data to train a model that can classify the new banknotes as real or fake.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Full Course for free.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/29/fake-currency-detection-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Logistic Regression", "Classification", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-29 15:58:41", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 99, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.3287309408187866, "description_category_runtime": 8.92, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9909477233886719, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.661, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.3287309408187866, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9909477233886719, "runtime_cat": 22.581, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965263658874", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "fake currency detection real problem individual business counterfeiter constantly finding new method technique produce counterfeit banknote essentially indistinguishable real money least human eye article introduce fake currency detection machine learningfake currency detection task binary classification machine learning enough data real fake banknote use data train model classify new banknote real fakealso read machine learning full course free", "tags_descriptive": ["Logistic Regression", "Classification", "Regression"]}
