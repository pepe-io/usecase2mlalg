The emphasis here is on \u2018automatic\u2019, that is, machine learning is about general-purpose methodologies that can be applied to many sets of data while producing something meaningful. In this article, I will take you through why you need to learn some maths for machine learning and some important topics of maths that you need to learn.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/20/maths-for-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-20 19:27:16", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 69, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.25386208295822144, "description_category_runtime": 6.905, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.977886974811554, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.188, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.25386208295822144, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.977886974811554, "runtime_cat": 17.093, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999950042459527", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "machine learning designing algorithm automatically extract valuable information data emphasis automatic machine learning generalpurpose methodology applied many set data producing something meaningful article take need learn math machine learning important topic math need learn", "tags_descriptive": ["Regression"]}
