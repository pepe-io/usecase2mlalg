{"title": "Text To Speech with Python", "description": "Text to speech is the generation of speech synthesized from the text. The technology is used to communicate with users when reading a screen is not possible or impractical. This not only opens up apps and information to use in new ways but can also make the world more accessible to people who cannot read text on a screen. In this article, I will take you through building your TTS with Python.The technology behind the TTS has evolved over the past few decades. Using natural language processing, it is now possible to produce very natural speech that includes changes in pitch, speed, pronunciation and inflexion.\u00a0", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/16/text-to-speech-with-python/", "tags": ["Recommender", "NLP"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["nltk"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-16 11:34:00", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 105, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.2792685925960541, "description_category_runtime": 9.084, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4997362792491913, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.049, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.2792685925960541, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.4997362792491913, "runtime_cat": 23.133, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999987418774392", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "text speech generation speech synthesized text technology used communicate user reading screen possible impractical open apps information use new way also make world accessible people cannot read text screen article take building tt pythonthe technology behind tt evolved past decade using natural language processing possible produce natural speech includes change pitch speed pronunciation inflexion", "tags_descriptive": ["Recommender", "Natural Language Processing (NLP)"]}
