{"title": "Sentiment Analysis", "description": "Sentiment analysis is the process by which all of the\u00a0content can be quantified to represent the ideas, beliefs, and opinions of entire sectors of the audience. The implications of sentiment analysis are hard to underestimate to increase the productivity of the business. Sentiment Analysis is one of those common NLP tasks that every Data Scientist need to perform.For example, you are a student in an online course and you have a problem. You post it on the class forum. The sentiment analysis would be able to not only identify the topic you are struggling with, but also how frustrated or discouraged you are, and tailor their comments to that sentiment. This is already happening because the technology is already there.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/13/sentiment-analysis/", "tags": ["Sentiment Analysis", "NLP", "Random Forest", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-13 13:18:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 120, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.21551470458507538, "description_category_runtime": 10.24, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8779283165931702, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.771, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.21551470458507538, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.8779283165931702, "runtime_cat": 26.011, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999992751181183", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "sentiment analysis process content quantified represent idea belief opinion entire sector audience implication sentiment analysis hard underestimate increase productivity business sentiment analysis one common nlp task every data scientist need performfor example student online course problem post class forum sentiment analysis would able identify topic struggling also frustrated discouraged tailor comment sentiment already happening technology already", "tags_descriptive": ["Sentiment Analysis", "Natural Language Processing (NLP)", "Random Forest", "Classification"]}
