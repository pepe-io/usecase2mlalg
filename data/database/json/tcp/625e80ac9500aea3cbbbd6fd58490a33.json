{"title": "Predict Weather with Machine Learning", "description": "In this article, I will train a model to predict weather with machine learning. We will act as if we do not have access to the weather forecast. We have access to a century of historical averages of global temperatures, including global maximum temperatures, global minimum temperatures, and global land and ocean temperatures. Having all this, we know that this is a supervised regression machine learning problem.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/30/predict-weather-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Random Forest", "Classification", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-30 16:05:53", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 67, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.01, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.012423381209373474, "description_category_runtime": 6.388, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.98543781042099, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.688, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.012423381209373474, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.98543781042099, "runtime_cat": 16.076, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999957867301428", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article train model predict weather machine learning act access weather forecast access century historical average global temperature including global maximum temperature global minimum temperature global land ocean temperature know supervised regression machine learning problem", "tags_descriptive": ["Random Forest", "Classification", "Regression"]}
