{"title": "ROC Curve in Machine Learning", "description": "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a popular tool used with binary classifiers. It is very similar to the precision/recall curve. Still, instead of plotting precision versus recall, the ROC curve plots the true positive rate (another name for recall) against the false positive rate (FPR). The FPR is the ratio of negative instances that are incorrectly classified as positive. It is equal to 1 \u2013 the true negative rate (TNR), which is the ratio of negative cases that are correctly classified as negative. The TNR is also called specificity.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/26/roc-curve-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Random Forest", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-26 23:29:51", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 91, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.0375608392059803, "description_category_runtime": 9.142, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.07162626832723618, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.594, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.0375608392059803, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.07162626832723618, "runtime_cat": 22.737, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999970184851947", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "receiver operating characteristic roc curve popular tool used binary classifier similar precisionrecall curve still instead plotting precision versus recall roc curve plot true positive rate another name recall false positive rate fpr fpr ratio negative instance incorrectly classified positive equal 1 true negative rate tnr ratio negative case correctly classified negative tnr also called specificity", "tags_descriptive": ["Random Forest", "Classification"]}
