{"title": "Titanic Survival with Machine Learning", "description": "In this article, I will take you through a very famous case study for machine learning practitioners which is to predict titanic survival with Machine Learning. I will first introduce you to this case study and then I will show you how we can build a predictive model to predict survival with Machine Learning.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/25/titanic-survival-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Logistic Regression", "CV", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-25 15:57:33", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 54, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.4927239716053009, "description_category_runtime": 5.246, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.988531768321991, "description_subcategory_runtime": 7.815, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.4927239716053009, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.988531768321991, "runtime_cat": 13.062, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978023872347", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article take famous case study machine learning practitioner predict titanic survival machine learning first introduce case study show build predictive model predict survival machine learning", "tags_descriptive": ["Logistic Regression", "Computer Vision (CV)", "Regression"]}
