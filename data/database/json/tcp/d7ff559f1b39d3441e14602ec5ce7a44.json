{"title": "Multiclass Classification", "description": "Where Binary Classification distinguish between two classes, Multiclass Classification or Multinomial Classification can distinguish between more than two classes.Some algorithms such as SGD classifiers, Random Forest Classifiers, and Naive Bayes classification are capable of handling multiple classes natively. Others such as Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machine Classifiers are strictly binary classifiers. However, there are various strategies that you can use to perform multiclass classification with multiple binary classifiers.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/21/multiclass-classification/", "tags": ["Regression", "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest", "Naive Bayes", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-21 01:10:19", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 69, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.4461694657802582, "description_category_runtime": 7.657, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8608964681625366, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.323, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.4461694657802582, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8608964681625366, "runtime_cat": 18.98, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974160772767", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "binary classification distinguish two class multiclass classification multinomial classification distinguish two classessome algorithm sgd classifier random forest classifier naive bayes classification capable handling multiple class natively others logistic regression support vector machine classifier strictly binary classifier however various strategy use perform multiclass classification multiple binary classifier", "tags_descriptive": ["Regression", "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest", "Naive Bayes", "Classification"]}
