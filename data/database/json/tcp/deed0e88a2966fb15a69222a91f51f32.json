{"title": "Data Science Project \u2013 Student Performance Analysis with Machine Learning", "description": "It takes a lot of manual effort to complete the evaluation process as even one college may contain thousands of students. In this Data Science Project we will evaluate the Performance of a student using Machine Learning techniques and python.You can download the data set you need for this project from here:Let\u2019s start with importing the libraries :To read the data set :#Output- (1000, 8)To look at the first 5 records in the data setLets\u00a0check\u00a0the\u00a0no.\u00a0of\u00a0unique\u00a0items\u00a0present\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0categorical\u00a0columnlets\u00a0check\u00a0the\u00a0percentage\u00a0of\u00a0missing\u00a0data\u00a0in\u00a0each\u00a0columns\u00a0present\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0data :To see comparison\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0other\u00a0attributes\u00a0with\u00a0respect\u00a0to\u00a0Math\u00a0MarksComparison\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0other\u00a0attributes\u00a0with\u00a0respect\u00a0to\u00a0Reading\u00a0Marks :Lets check the Effect of Lunch on Student\u2019s PerformnceLets check the Effect of Test Preparation Course on Scores", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/05/21/data-science-project-student-performance-analysis-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Regression", "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-21 18:44:27", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 96, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.4212675988674164, "description_category_runtime": 15.42, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8788022994995117, "description_subcategory_runtime": 24.284, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.4212675988674164, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.8788022994995117, "runtime_cat": 39.705, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965032412366", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "take lot manual effort complete evaluation process even one college may contain thousand student data science project evaluate performance student using machine learning technique pythonyou download data set need project herelets start importing library read data set output 1000 8to look first 5 record data setlets check unique item present categorical columnlets check percentage missing data column present data see comparison attribute respect math markscomparison attribute respect reading mark let check effect lunch student performncelets check effect test preparation course score", "tags_descriptive": ["Regression", "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest", "Classification"]}
