{"title": "OOP for Machine Learning", "description": "The Classes in Python are the main tool used for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). A Class is a coding structure and a specific tool to implement new kinds of objects in Python that supports inheritance. OOP offers a very different and effective way of programming. We can use OOP for Machine Learning also to build Models.The use of OOP is entirely optional in Machine Learning as we already have libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow from where we can easily use algorithms. So learning Object-Oriented Programming for Machine Learning is not that necessary, but as a programmer, you should not limit yourself. So in this article, I will take you through how you can use OOP for Machine Learning to build models.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/08/oop-for-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Linear Regression", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-08 13:56:57", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 120, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.1607833355665207, "description_category_runtime": 10.978, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9888253808021545, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.954, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.1607833355665207, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9888253808021545, "runtime_cat": 27.931, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978105178242", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "class python main tool used objectoriented programming oop class coding structure specific tool implement new kind object python support inheritance oop offer different effective way programming use oop machine learning also build modelsthe use oop entirely optional machine learning already library like scikitlearn tensorflow easily use algorithm learning objectoriented programming machine learning necessary programmer limit article take use oop machine learning build model", "tags_descriptive": ["Linear Regression", "Regression"]}
