{"title": "Next Word Prediction Model", "description": "Most of the keyboards in smartphones give next word prediction features; google also uses next word prediction based on our browsing history. So a preloaded data is also stored in the keyboard function of our smartphones to predict the next word correctly. In this article, I will train a Deep Learning model for next word prediction using Python. I will use the Tensorflow and Keras library in Python for next word prediction model.For making a Next Word Prediction model, I will train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). So let\u2019s start with this task now without wasting any time.Also, Read \u2013 100+ Machine Learning Projects Solved and Explained.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/20/next-word-prediction-model/", "tags": ["LSTM", "RNN", "DL"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "nltk"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-20 20:51:31", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 107, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.3323097229003906, "description_category_runtime": 9.956, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.987450122833252, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.244, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.3323097229003906, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.987450122833252, "runtime_cat": 25.201, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999971841979336", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "keyboard smartphones give next word prediction feature google also us next word prediction based browsing history preloaded data also stored keyboard function smartphones predict next word correctly article train deep learning model next word prediction using python use tensorflow kera library python next word prediction modelfor making next word prediction model train recurrent neural network rnn let start task without wasting timealso read 100 machine learning project solved explained", "tags_descriptive": ["Long short-term memory (LSTM)", "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)", "Deep Learning (DL)"]}
