{"title": "Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning", "description": "Heart disease\u00a0describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia) and heart defects you\u2019re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data science. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge.In this Data Science Project I will be applying Machine Learning techniques to classify whether a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not.Importing the required modules :Here we will be experimenting using KNeighborsClassifier :To get correlation of each feature in the data setIt\u2019s always a good practice to work with a data set where the target classes are of approximately equal size. Thus, let\u2019s check for the same :", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/05/20/heart-disease-prediction-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Random Forest", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-20 14:20:01", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 156, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.5215014815330505, "description_category_runtime": 13.752, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9912686347961426, "description_subcategory_runtime": 21.987, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.5215014815330505, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9912686347961426, "runtime_cat": 35.739, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999983787624045", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "heart disease describes range condition affect heart disease heart disease umbrella include blood vessel disease coronary artery disease heart rhythm problem arrhythmia heart defect youre born congenital heart defect among othersheart disease one biggest cause morbidity mortality among population world prediction cardiovascular disease regarded one important subject section clinical data science amount data healthcare industry hugein data science project applying machine learning technique classify whether person suffering heart disease notimporting required module experimenting using kneighborsclassifier get correlation feature data setits always good practice work data set target class approximately equal size thus let check", "tags_descriptive": ["Random Forest", "Classification"]}
