I recently wrote an article on what is Deepfake and how it is dangerous. If you don\u2019t know what is Deepfake then I will suggest you have a quick look at my previous article here, before getting your hands dirty with the task of Deepfake detection with Python and Machine Learning.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/10/03/deepfake-detection-with-python/", "tags": ["CNN"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-10-03 10:12:38", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 66, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.17623481154441833, "description_category_runtime": 6.507, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8299247622489929, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.735, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.17623481154441833, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8299247622489929, "runtime_cat": 16.242, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972900328887", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article take deepfake detection python machine learning recently wrote article deepfake dangerous dont know deepfake suggest quick look previous article getting hand dirty task deepfake detection python machine learning", "tags_descriptive": ["Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
