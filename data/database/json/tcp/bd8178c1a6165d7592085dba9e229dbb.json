{"title": "Landmark Detection with Machine Learning", "description": "Have you ever looked through your vacation photos and wondered: what is the name of this temple I visited in India? Who created this monument that I saw in California? Landmark Detection can help us detect the names of these places. But how does the detection of landmarks work? In this article, I will introduce you to a machine learning project on landmark detection with Python.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/08/landmark-detection-with-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification", "VGG"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-11-08 12:10:19", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 66, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.20547130703926086, "description_category_runtime": 6.177, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9935945868492126, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.491, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.20547130703926086, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9935945868492126, "runtime_cat": 15.668, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999947417792181", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "ever looked vacation photo wondered name temple visited india created monument saw california landmark detection help u detect name place detection landmark work article introduce machine learning project landmark detection python", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "VGG"]}
