{"title": "Polynomial Regression Algorithm", "description": "What will you do if your data is a bit more complicated than a straight line? A good alternative for you is that you can use a linear model to fit in a nonlinear data. You can use the add powers of ever feature as the new features, and then you can use the new set of features to train a Linear Model. In Machine Learning, this technique is known as Polynomial Regression.Let\u2019s understand Polynomial Regression from an example. I will first generate a nonlinear data which is based on a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation is in the form of ax2+bx+c; I will first import all the necessary libraries then I will create a quadratic equation:Now let\u2019s make a quadratic equation:", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/27/polynomial-regression-algorithm/", "tags": ["Linear Regression", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-27 22:27:03", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 122, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.16628262400627136, "description_category_runtime": 11.596, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.875353217124939, "description_subcategory_runtime": 18.385, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.16628262400627136, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.875353217124939, "runtime_cat": 29.981, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999980830880305", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "data bit complicated straight line good alternative use linear model fit nonlinear data use add power ever feature new feature use new set feature train linear model machine learning technique known polynomial regressionlets understand polynomial regression example first generate nonlinear data based quadratic equation quadratic equation form ax2bxc first import necessary library create quadratic equationnow let make quadratic equation", "tags_descriptive": ["Linear Regression", "Regression"]}
