{"title": "Fake News Classification with Machine Learning", "description": "The problem of the fake news publication is not new and it already has been reported in ancient ages, but it has started having a huge impact especially on social media users.Such false information should be detected as soon as possible to avoid its negative influence on the readers and in some cases on their decisions, e.g., during the election.In this Data Science project we will be creating a fake news classifier using Machine Learning techniques and Python.You can download the data set you need for this task from here :Let\u2019s start with this classifier#Output- (18285, 5)#Output\u2013\u2018civilian kill singl us airstrik identifi\u2019#Output\u2013(18285, 5000)#Output- 0.8810273405136703", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/05/22/data-science-project-fake-news-classification/", "tags": ["Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern", "sklearn", "vocabulary", "nltk"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-22 20:10:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 104, "sentences": 1, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Media & Publishing", "description_category_score": 0.06853507459163666, "description_category_runtime": 11.407, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.964273989200592, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.516, "category": "Media & Publishing", "category_score": 0.06853507459163666, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.964273989200592, "runtime_cat": 28.924, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958328010672", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "problem fake news publication new already reported ancient age started huge impact especially social medium userssuch false information detected soon possible avoid negative influence reader case decision eg electionin data science project creating fake news classifier using machine learning technique pythonyou download data set need task let start classifieroutput 18285 5outputcivilian kill singl u airstrik identifioutput18285 5000output 08810273405136703", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification"]}
