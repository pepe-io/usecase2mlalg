{"title": "Roadmap for Machine Learning", "description": "In this article, I will take you through a complete roadmap for Machine Learning. If you don\u2019t know about me, I was from a commerce background even I followed the same roadmap from learning a programming language to mastering the concepts of Machine Learning.Before moving further with the complete roadmap on Machine Learning if you are not from a science background and still think about how you can master machine learning, what skills you need, what difficulties you may face, and what degree you need? I have already shared my complete journey from commerce to machine learning that you can read here.Now, I will take you through the complete roadmap for machine learning. Before exploring each step in the roadmap let\u2019s have a quick look at the complete roadmap for machine learning below.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/06/roadmap-for-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Regression", "DL", "Linear Regression", "Clustering", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-11-06 17:57:45", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 133, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.2565750479698181, "description_category_runtime": 10.974, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.961592435836792, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.243, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.2565750479698181, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.961592435836792, "runtime_cat": 28.218, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999961384191135", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article take complete roadmap machine learning dont know commerce background even followed roadmap learning programming language mastering concept machine learningbefore moving complete roadmap machine learning science background still think master machine learning skill need difficulty may face degree need already shared complete journey commerce machine learning read herenow take complete roadmap machine learning exploring step roadmap let quick look complete roadmap machine learning", "tags_descriptive": ["Regression", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Linear Regression", "Clustering", "Classification"]}
