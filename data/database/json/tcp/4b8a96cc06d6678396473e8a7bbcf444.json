{"title": "StandardScaler in Machine Learning", "description": "In Machine Learning, StandardScaler is used to resize the distribution of values \u200b\u200bso that the mean of the observed values \u200b\u200bis 0 and the standard deviation is 1. In this article, I will walk you through how to use StandardScaler in Machine Learning.StandardScaler is an important technique that is mainly performed as a preprocessing step before many machine learning models, in order to standardize the range of functionality of the input dataset.Also, Read \u2013 Why Python is the best language for Machine Learning.Some machine learning practitioners tend to standardize their data blindly before each machine learning model without making the effort to understand why it should be used, or even whether it is needed or not. So you need to understand when you should use the StandardScaler to scale your data.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/22/standardscaler-in-machine-learning/", "tags": [], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-22 16:26:51", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 131, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.0257542934268713, "description_category_runtime": 11.594, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9545449614524841, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.661, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.0257542934268713, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9545449614524841, "runtime_cat": 29.255, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999970758470027", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "machine learning standardscaler used resize distribution value mean observed value 0 standard deviation 1 article walk use standardscaler machine learningstandardscaler important technique mainly performed preprocessing step many machine learning model order standardize range functionality input datasetalso read python best language machine learningsome machine learning practitioner tend standardize data blindly machine learning model without making effort understand used even whether needed need understand use standardscaler scale data", "tags_descriptive": []}
