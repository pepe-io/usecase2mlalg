{"title": "Save Machine Learning Models", "description": "In this article, I\u2019ll walk you through how to save machine learning models. Model progress can be recorded during and after training. This means that a model can pick up where it left off and avoid long periods of training. You should know how to save complex machine learning models so that you can share your model and your team members can recreate your work.You should know how to save machine learning models because in the professional world you will be working with as complex machine learning models which will need you to work within teams and will require days. So to share your work within the teams and continue where you left will always require you to know how you can save machine learning models.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Full Course for free.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/27/save-machine-learning-models/", "tags": ["ReLu"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-27 18:59:19", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 134, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.47860968112945557, "description_category_runtime": 10.908, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9634681344032288, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.745, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.47860968112945557, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9634681344032288, "runtime_cat": 27.654, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965435737646", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article ill walk save machine learning model model progress recorded training mean model pick left avoid long period training know save complex machine learning model share model team member recreate workyou know save machine learning model professional world working complex machine learning model need work within team require day share work within team continue left always require know save machine learning modelsalso read machine learning full course free", "tags_descriptive": ["Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)"]}
