{"title": "Image Classification with TensorFlow in Machine Learning", "description": "In this article, I am going to explain how we can train a neural network model for the task of image classification with TensorFlow. For those new to TensorFlow, TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that allow researchers to push cutting-edge advancements in ML, and developers to easily build and deploy machine learning-based applications.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/30/image-classification-with-tensorflow-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["CV", "DL", "ReLu", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "pattern", "tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-30 10:37:46", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 70, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.3867368698120117, "description_category_runtime": 7.447, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9759615063667297, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.539, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.3867368698120117, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9759615063667297, "runtime_cat": 18.986, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999960419502384", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article going explain train neural network model task image classification tensorflow new tensorflow tensorflow endtoend opensource platform machine learning comprehensive flexible ecosystem tool library community resource allow researcher push cuttingedge advancement ml developer easily build deploy machine learningbased application", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)", "Classification"]}
