{"title": "Image Recognition with Machine Learning using PyTorch", "description": "Humans take no effort to distinguish a dog, cat, or flying saucer. But this process is quite difficult for a computer to emulate: it only looks easy because God designs our brains incredibly well to recognize images. One common example of image recognition with machine learning is optical character recognition. In this article, I will take you through building an Image Recognition model with Machine Learning using PyTorch.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/26/image-recognition-with-machine-learning-using-pytorch/", "tags": ["ResNet", "CV", "DL", "CNN", "VGG", "AlexNet"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["pattern", "Pillow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-26 16:17:31", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 68, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.006982139777392149, "description_category_runtime": 6.815, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6572186350822449, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.997, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.006982139777392149, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6572186350822449, "runtime_cat": 16.813, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999936547214069", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "human take effort distinguish dog cat flying saucer process quite difficult computer emulate look easy god design brain incredibly well recognize image one common example image recognition machine learning optical character recognition article take building image recognition model machine learning using pytorch", "tags_descriptive": ["ResNet", "Computer Vision (CV)", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)", "VGG", "AlexNet"]}
