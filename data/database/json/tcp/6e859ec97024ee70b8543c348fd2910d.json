{"title": "Gender Classification Model", "description": "Indeed, two people can never have the same fingerprints, it is unique in every human. But using fingerprints we can classify gender, whether it\u2019s male or female. In this article, I will take you through a Gender Classification Model which I will train using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.Now you must be thinking about how I will do Gender Classification. I will build a Convolutional Neural Network that can classify the gender using the fingerprints. For this task, I will use a dataset that contains over 55000 images of fingerprints of each finger.Also, Read \u2013 Work on Artificial Intelligence Projects.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/02/gender-classification-model/", "tags": ["Recommender", "DL", "CNN", "ReLu", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-02 18:15:45", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 101, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.19047172367572784, "description_category_runtime": 9.458, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.957518458366394, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.206, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.19047172367572784, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.957518458366394, "runtime_cat": 23.664, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967789813017", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "indeed two people never fingerprint unique every human using fingerprint classify gender whether male female article take gender classification model train using deep learning convolutional neural networksnow must thinking gender classification build convolutional neural network classify gender using fingerprint task use dataset contains 55000 image fingerprint fingeralso read work artificial intelligence project", "tags_descriptive": ["Recommender", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)", "Classification"]}
