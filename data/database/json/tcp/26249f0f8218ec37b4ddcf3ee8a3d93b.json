{"title": "Employee Attrition Prediction with Python", "description": "In this article, I\u2019ll introduce you to a machine learning project on employee attrition prediction with Python programming language. Employees are considered the backbone of an organization. The success or failure of the organization depends on the employees who work for an organization. Organizations must deal with the problems when trained, skilled and experienced employees leave the organization for better opportunities.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/21/employee-attrition-prediction-with-python/", "tags": ["Random Forest", "Classification", "Regression"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-11-21 12:18:08", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 61, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.21387238800525665, "description_category_runtime": 6.021, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9781089425086975, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.054, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.21387238800525665, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9781089425086975, "runtime_cat": 15.077, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967194748214", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article ill introduce machine learning project employee attrition prediction python programming language employee considered backbone organization success failure organization depends employee work organization organization must deal problem trained skilled experienced employee leave organization better opportunity", "tags_descriptive": ["Random Forest", "Classification", "Regression"]}
