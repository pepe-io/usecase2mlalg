Well, this is a very common problem. We face this when our csv file has an index column which has no name. here is how we can get rid of it.Now, we\u2019ll make an attribute that would contain date (month, year). So that we could get temperature values with the timeline.On a closer look, by clicking on One Year View, we can see that the graph seems distorted because this is how the values really are. The temperature varies every year with months.We also will stick to these seasons for our analysis.A cluster size of 3 seems a good choice hereThere is a cluster from 26.2-27.5 and mean temperature for most months during history has been between 26.8-26.9Let\u2019s see if we can get some insights from yearly mean temperature data.
