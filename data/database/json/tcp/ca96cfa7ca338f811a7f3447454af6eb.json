{"title": "Predict US Elections with Python", "description": "In this article, I will take you through how we can predict the US presidential elections with Python. Here, I will not train any machine learning model. I will analyze the sentiments of people for the candidates and then at the end, I will conclude based on the most number of positive and negative tweets against the candidates.The datasets that I am using in this task to predict the US Elections are collected from twitter by the official twitter handles of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. You can download the datasets that I am using from here.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Full Course For Free.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/10/01/predict-us-elections-with-python/", "tags": ["Classification", "Sentiment Analysis", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["textblob"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-10-01 20:36:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 105, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.00632901955395937, "description_category_runtime": 9.057, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.97597336769104, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.342, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.00632901955395937, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.97597336769104, "runtime_cat": 22.4, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999964764923591", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article take predict u presidential election python train machine learning model analyze sentiment people candidate end conclude based number positive negative tweet candidatesthe datasets using task predict u election collected twitter official twitter handle donald trump joe biden download datasets using herealso read machine learning full course free", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Sentiment Analysis", "Classification"]}
