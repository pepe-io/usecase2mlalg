{"title": "Binary Classification Model", "description": "Binary Classification is a type of classification model that have two label of classes. For example an email spam detection model contains two label of classes as spam or not spam. Most of the times the tasks of binary classification includes one label in a normal state, and another label in an abnormal state. In this article I will take you through Binary Classification in Machine Learning using Python.I will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. This set has been studied so much that it is often called the \u201chello world\u201d of Machine Learning.Whenever people come up with new classification algorithm they are curious to see how it will perform on MNIST, and anyone who learns Machine Learning tackles this dataset sooner or later. So let\u2019s import some libraries to start with our Binary Classification model:Scikit-Learn provides many helper functions to download popular datasets. MNIST is one of them. The following code fetches the MNIST dataset:Now Let\u2019s look at the data:(70000, 784)(70000,)784There are 70,000 images, and each image has 784 features. This is because each image is 28\u00d728 pixels, and each feature simply represents one pixel\u2019s intensity, from 0 (white) to 255(black). Let\u2019s take a peak at one digit from the dataset. All you need to do is grab an instance\u2019s feature vector, reshape it to a 28\u00d728 array, and display it using Matplotlib\u2019s imshow() function:This looks like a 5, and indeed that\u2019s what the label tells us:5Note that the label is a string. Most Machine Learning Algorithms expect numbers, so let\u2019s cast y to integer:Now before training a Binary Classification model, let\u2019 have a look at the digits:You should always create a test set and set it aside before inspecting the data closely. The MNIST dataset is actually already split into a training set and a test set:", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/20/binary-classification-model/", "tags": ["Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-20 01:05:06", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 329, "sentences": 14, "sum_nltk": "Binary Classification is a type of classification model that have two label of classes.\nIn this article I will take you through Binary Classification in Machine Learning using Python.I will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau.\nEach image is labeled with the digit it represents.\nThis set has been studied so much that it is often called the \u201chello world\u201d of Machine Learning.Whenever people come up with new classification algorithm they are curious to see how it will perform on MNIST, and anyone who learns Machine Learning tackles this dataset sooner or later.\nSo let\u2019s import some libraries to start with our Binary Classification model:Scikit-Learn provides many helper functions to download popular datasets.\nThe following code fetches the MNIST dataset:Now Let\u2019s look at the data:(70000, 784)(70000,)784There are 70,000 images, and each image has 784 features.\nMost Machine Learning Algorithms expect numbers, so let\u2019s cast y to integer:Now before training a Binary Classification model, let\u2019 have a look at the digits:You should always create a test set and set it aside before inspecting the data closely.\nThe MNIST dataset is actually already split into a training set and a test set:", "sum_nltk_words": 204, "sum_nltk_runtime": 0.004, "sum_t5": "binary classification is a type of classification model that have two label of classes. for example an email spam detection model contains two label of classes as spam or not spam. in this article i will take you through binary classification in machine learning using Python. i will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. each image is labeled with the digit it represents.", "sum_t5_words": 84, "sum_t5_runtime": 6.669, "runtime": 0.003, "nltk_category": "Finance", "nltk_category_score": 0.3317359983921051, "nltk_category_runtime": 19.458, "nltk_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "nltk_subcategory_score": 0.9230262041091919, "nltk_subcategory_runtime": 31.587, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.3317359983921051, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9230262041091919, "runtime_cat": 51.045, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999994122438707", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "binary classification type classification model two label class example email spam detection model contains two label class spam spam time task binary classification includes one label normal state another label abnormal state article take binary classification machine learning using pythoni using mnist dataset set 70000 small image digit handwritten high school student employee u census bureau image labeled digit represents set studied much often called hello world machine learningwhenever people come new classification algorithm curious see perform mnist anyone learns machine learning tackle dataset sooner later let import library start binary classification modelscikitlearn provides many helper function download popular datasets mnist one following code fetch mnist datasetnow let look data70000 78470000784there 70000 image image 784 feature image 2828 pixel feature simply represents one pixel intensity 0 white 255black let take peak one digit dataset need grab instance feature vector reshape 2828 array display using matplotlibs imshow functionthis look like 5 indeed thats label tell us5note label string machine learning algorithm expect number let cast integernow training binary classification model let look digitsyou always create test set set aside inspecting data closely mnist dataset actually already split training set test set", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification"]}
