{"title": "Naive Bayes Classification in Machine Learning", "description": "In Machine Learning Naive Bayes models are a group of high-speed and simple classification algorithms that are often suitable for very high-dimensional datasets. Because they are so fast and have so few tunable parameters, they end up being very useful as a quick-and-dirty baseline for a classification problem. This article will focus on an intuitive explanation of how naive Bayes classification work, followed by a couple of examples of them in action on some datasets.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/05/naive-bayes-classification-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Bayesian", "Classification", "Naive Bayes", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-05 20:45:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 75, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.11465258151292801, "description_category_runtime": 7.834, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9831056594848633, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.223, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.11465258151292801, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9831056594848633, "runtime_cat": 19.056, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967374300102", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "machine learning naive bayes model group highspeed simple classification algorithm often suitable highdimensional datasets fast tunable parameter end useful quickanddirty baseline classification problem article focus intuitive explanation naive bayes classification work followed couple example action datasets", "tags_descriptive": ["Bayesian", "Classification", "Naive Bayes", "Classification"]}
