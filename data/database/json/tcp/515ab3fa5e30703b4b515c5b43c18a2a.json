Time Series Forecasting is used in\u00a0training\u00a0a\u00a0Machine\u00a0learning\u00a0model\u00a0to predict\u00a0future\u00a0values\u00a0with the usage of\u00a0historical\u00a0importance.Time Series\u00a0Analysis\u00a0is\u00a0broadly speaking\u00a0used in\u00a0training machine learning\u00a0models\u00a0for the Economy,\u00a0Weather\u00a0forecasting, stock\u00a0price\u00a0prediction, and\u00a0additionally\u00a0in\u00a0Sales\u00a0forecasting. It can be\u00a0said\u00a0that Time Series Analysis is\u00a0widely\u00a0used in\u00a0facts\u00a0based\u00a0on non-stationary\u00a0features.In this article, I will use different methods for sales forecasting using the time series analysis with python. You can download the dataset that I have used in this article below.Let\u2019s start with this tutorial on Time Series Forecasting using Python by importing the libraries.There are different categories in the dataset, lets start from time series analysis and sales forecasting of furniture.Timestamp(\u20182014\u201301\u201306 00:00:00\u2019), Timestamp(\u20182017\u201312\u201330 00:00:00\u2019)Data Preprocessing includes removing columns that we don\u2019t need, looking for missing values, etc.The\u00a0current\u00a0DateTime\u00a0looks\u00a0a little\u00a0challenging\u00a0to work\u00a0within the\u00a0dataset, so I will use the\u00a0price\u00a0of\u00a0each day\u00a0sales\u00a0on\u00a0average\u00a0of the month for\u00a0maintaining\u00a0it simple. I will use the start\u00a0of each\u00a0month as a timestamp. Some patterns can be drawn from the above figure, the time series is patterned seasonally like sales are low at the beginning of every year, and sales increases at the end of the year.Now let\u2019s visualize this data using the time series decomposition method which will allow our time series to decompose into three components:The above figure shows that the sales of furniture is not stable because of the seasons.ARIMA is one of the most used methods in time series forecasting. ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. Now I will use the ARIMA method in the further process of time series forecasting.This step is the process of selection of parameters in our Time Series Forecasting model for furniture sales.Now I will run Model diagnosis; running a model diagnosis is essential in Time Series Forecasting to investigate any unusual behavior in the model.To understand the accuracy of our time series forecasting model, I will compare predicted sales with actual sales, and I will set the forecasts to start at 2017-01-01 to the end of the dataset.The above figure is showing the observed values in comparison with the forecast predictions. The picture is aligned with the actual sales, really well, which is showing an upward shift in the beginning and captures the seasonality at the end of the year.The Mean Squared Error of our forecasts is 22993.58The Root Mean Squared Error of our forecasts is 151.64In statistics, the\u00a0Mean\u00a0Squared Error (MSE) of an estimator measures the\u00a0average\u00a0of the squares of the error that is, the common squared\u00a0distinction\u00a0among\u00a0the\u00a0anticipated\u00a0values and what is\u00a0estimated. The MSE is a\u00a0measure\u00a0of the\u00a0fine\u00a0of an estimator, its miles\u00a0continually\u00a0non-negative, and the smaller the MSE, the\u00a0nearer\u00a0we are\u00a0to\u00a0locating\u00a0the road\u00a0of\u00a0an excellent\u00a0fit.Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) tells us that our\u00a0version\u00a0was\u00a0capable of\u00a0forecast the average\u00a0daily\u00a0furniture\u00a0income\u00a0in the\u00a0test\u00a0set\u00a0within\u00a0151.64\u00a0of the\u00a0actual\u00a0income. Our furniture\u00a0day by day\u00a0income\u00a0range\u00a0from around\u00a0400 to over 1200. In my opinion,\u00a0that is\u00a0a\u00a0pretty\u00a0good\u00a0version\u00a0so far.Our Time Series Forecasting model,\u00a0without a doubt,\u00a0captured furniture\u00a0profits\u00a0seasonality. As we forecast\u00a0further\u00a0out into the future,\u00a0it\u2019s very natural\u00a0for us to\u00a0become\u00a0very\u00a0much less\u00a0assured\u00a0in our values. This gets reflected\u00a0by\u00a0way\u00a0of the\u00a0self-belief\u00a0intervals\u00a0generated\u00a0via\u00a0our model, which grows\u00a0more significant\u00a0as we move\u00a0similarly\u00a0out into the future.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/01/time-series-analysis-and-forecasting-with-python/", "tags": [], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["statsmodels", "pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-01 21:08:52", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 468, "sentences": 14, "sum_nltk": "You can download the dataset that I have used in this article below.Let\u2019s start with this tutorial on Time Series Forecasting using Python by importing the libraries.There are different categories in the dataset, lets start from time series analysis and sales forecasting of furniture.Timestamp(\u20182014\u201301\u201306 00:00:00\u2019), Timestamp(\u20182017\u201312\u201330 00:00:00\u2019)Data Preprocessing includes removing columns that we don\u2019t need, looking for missing values, etc.The\u00a0current\u00a0DateTime\u00a0looks\u00a0a little\u00a0challenging\u00a0to work\u00a0within the\u00a0dataset, so I will use the\u00a0price\u00a0of\u00a0each day\u00a0sales\u00a0on\u00a0average\u00a0of the month for\u00a0maintaining\u00a0it simple.\nNow I will use the ARIMA method in the further process of time series forecasting.This step is the process of selection of parameters in our Time Series Forecasting model for furniture sales.Now I will run Model diagnosis;
