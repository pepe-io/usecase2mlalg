{"title": "Predict Migration with Machine Learning", "description": "In this article, I will take you through a real-world task of Machine Learning task to predict the migration of humans between countries. Human migration is a type of human mobility, where a journey involves a person moving to change their domicile. Predicting human migration as accurately as possible is important in city planning applications, international trade, the spread of infectious diseases, conservation planning, and public policymaking.Also, Read \u2013 Build a Genetic Algorithm with Python.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/08/predict-migration-with-machine-learning/", "tags": [], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-08 14:27:09", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 75, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.04179772734642029, "description_category_runtime": 7.383, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9959986209869385, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.439, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.04179772734642029, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9959986209869385, "runtime_cat": 18.823, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958420621502", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article take realworld task machine learning task predict migration human country human migration type human mobility journey involves person moving change domicile predicting human migration accurately possible important city planning application international trade spread infectious disease conservation planning public policymakingalso read build genetic algorithm python", "tags_descriptive": []}
