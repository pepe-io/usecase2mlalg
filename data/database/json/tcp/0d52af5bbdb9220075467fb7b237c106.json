{"title": "Data Visualization for Machine Learning", "description": "As part of any machine learning task, data visualization plays an important role in learning more about the available data and in identifying any major patterns. In this article, I\u2019ll walk you through the most important techniques of data visualization for machine learning that you need to know when working in a professional environment.Here I will cover some important techniques that could help us meet the challenges of data visualization for machine learning, such as parallel coordinate plots, summary data tables, drawing ANN charts and many more.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Full Course For free.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/10/10/data-visualization-for-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Regression", "DL", "Decision Tree", "ANN", "ReLu", "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest", "Naive Bayes", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-10-10 13:58:59", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 95, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.31217044591903687, "description_category_runtime": 8.682, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.911069929599762, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.942, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.31217044591903687, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.911069929599762, "runtime_cat": 21.625, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967526118845", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "part machine learning task data visualization play important role learning available data identifying major pattern article ill walk important technique data visualization machine learning need know working professional environmenthere cover important technique could help u meet challenge data visualization machine learning parallel coordinate plot summary data table drawing ann chart many morealso read machine learning full course free", "tags_descriptive": ["Regression", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Decision Tree", "Artificial Neural Network (ANN)", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)", "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest", "Naive Bayes", "Classification"]}
