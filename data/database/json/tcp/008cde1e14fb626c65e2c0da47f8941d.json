{"title": "Barcode and QR code Reader with Python", "description": "In this article, I will walk you through how to make a barcode and Qr code reader with Python and Machine Learning. This is a great machine learning task to get started with computer vision.Barcodes and QR codes are very cool and interesting because they store information in a different format. The fun part about them is that we can\u2019t tell what they are storing until we analyze them. It\u2019s like playing a puzzle game. And another thing I love about them is that they can be part of the physical world and still connect us to the internet world.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Full Course for free.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/10/23/barcode-and-qr-code-reader-with-python/", "tags": ["Recommender", "CV"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["Pillow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-10-23 14:04:44", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 108, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.22759920358657837, "description_category_runtime": 10.018, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9676257371902466, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.473, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.22759920358657837, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9676257371902466, "runtime_cat": 25.491, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999998453386597", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article walk make barcode qr code reader python machine learning great machine learning task get started computer visionbarcodes qr code cool interesting store information different format fun part cant tell storing analyze like playing puzzle game another thing love part physical world still connect u internet worldalso read machine learning full course free", "tags_descriptive": ["Recommender", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
