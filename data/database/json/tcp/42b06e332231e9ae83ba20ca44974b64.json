{"title": "Image Classification with ANN", "description": "Birds inspired us to fly, nature inspired us to countless inventions. It seems logical, then to look at the brain\u2019s architecture for inspiration on how to build an Intelligent Machine. This is the logic that sparked Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANN is a Machine Learning Model inspired by the networks of biological neurons found in our brains. However, although planes were inspired by birds, they don\u2019t have to flap their wings. Similarly, ANN have gradually become quite different from their biological cousins. In this Article, I will build an Image Classification model with ANN to show you how ANN works.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/07/19/image-classification-with-ann/", "tags": ["ANN", "ReLu", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["keras", "sklearn", "tensorflow"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-19 01:30:39", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 100, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.03476693481206894, "description_category_runtime": 9.094, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9558897614479065, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.228, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.03476693481206894, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9558897614479065, "runtime_cat": 23.322, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999976009956689", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "bird inspired u fly nature inspired u countless invention seems logical look brain architecture inspiration build intelligent machine logic sparked artificial neural network ann ann machine learning model inspired network biological neuron found brain however although plane inspired bird dont flap wing similarly ann gradually become quite different biological cousin article build image classification model ann show ann work", "tags_descriptive": ["Artificial Neural Network (ANN)", "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)", "Classification"]}
