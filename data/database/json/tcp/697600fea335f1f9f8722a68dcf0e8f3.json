If you don\u2019t know how to prevent it, leaks will frequently occur and ruin your models in subtle and dangerous ways. It is, therefore, one of the most important concepts for all machine learning practitioners.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/05/data-leakage-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-05 14:55:55", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 50, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.17334425449371338, "description_category_runtime": 5.498, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6650730967521667, "description_subcategory_runtime": 8.086, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.17334425449371338, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6650730967521667, "runtime_cat": 13.585, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972264295824", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "article learn data leakage avoid dont know prevent leak frequently occur ruin model subtle dangerous way therefore one important concept machine learning practitioner", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification"]}
