{"title": "Word Embeddings in Machine Learning", "description": "Word embeddings or word vectors represent each word numerically so that the vector matches how that word is used or what it means. Vector encodings are learned by considering the context in which the words appear.Words that appear in similar contexts will have similar vectors. For example, the vectors for \u201cleopard\u201d, \u201clion\u201d and \u201ctiger\u201d will be close to each other, while they will be far from \u201cplanet\u201d and \u201ccastle\u201d.Also, Read \u2013 Machine Learning Project on Rainfall Prediction Model.", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/09/11/word-embeddings-in-machine-learning/", "tags": ["Classification", "SVM"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["spacy", "sklearn", "xgboost"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-11 15:00:04", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 78, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.13325181603431702, "description_category_runtime": 9.095, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9469380974769592, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.594, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.13325181603431702, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9469380974769592, "runtime_cat": 22.689, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977352181599", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "word embeddings word vector represent word numerically vector match word used mean vector encoding learned considering context word appearwords appear similar context similar vector example vector leopard lion tiger close far planet castlealso read machine learning project rainfall prediction model", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Support Vector Machines (SVM)"]}
