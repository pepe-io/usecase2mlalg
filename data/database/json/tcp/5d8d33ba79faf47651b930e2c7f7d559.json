{"title": "Random Forest Algorithm", "description": "The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble of the Decision Trees algorithm. A Decision Tree model is generally trained using the Bagging Classifier. If you don\u2019t want to use a bagging classifier algorithm to pass it through the Decision Tree Classification model, you can use a Random Forest algorithm as it is more convenient and better optimized for Decision Tree Classification. In this article, I will take you through the Random Forest algorithm in Machine Learning.I will use all the CPU cores to train a RandomForestClassifier algorithm with 500 trees. But first, let\u2019s start with importing the necessary libraries and data preparation to fit into a RandomForestClassifier algorithm:", "link": "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/08/03/random-forest-algorithm/", "tags": ["Decision Tree", "Random Forest", "Classification"], "kind": "Project", "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "thecleverprogrammer.com", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-03 13:24:30", "date_scraped": "2020-12-20 00:00:00", "words": 108, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.2697058618068695, "description_category_runtime": 9.823, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9939337372779846, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.328, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.2697058618068695, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9939337372779846, "runtime_cat": 25.151, "programming_language": "Python", "ml_score": "1.0", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999949797817178", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "random forest algorithm ensemble decision tree algorithm decision tree model generally trained using bagging classifier dont want use bagging classifier algorithm pas decision tree classification model use random forest algorithm convenient better optimized decision tree classification article take random forest algorithm machine learningi use cpu core train randomforestclassifier algorithm 500 tree first let start importing necessary library data preparation fit randomforestclassifier algorithm", "tags_descriptive": ["Decision Tree", "Random Forest", "Classification"]}
