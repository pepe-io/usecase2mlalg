{"title": "One-shot method to tackle kinship problem [Keras]", "description": "'You seem familiar' - One-shot approach to tackle kinship problemIn this notebook we are going to solve this kinship problem using the popular one-shot learning approach and build a embedding generator to find the cosine-similarity amongst the images of people from a family. Playing with cosine similarity, we are going to design a model that is able to recognize the people of a family and people related by blood.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/thanatoz/one-shot-method-to-tackle-kinship-problem-keras", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-05-25 09:55:28", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:27:41", "words": 69, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.22433899343013763, "description_category_runtime": 7.055, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.809511125087738, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.79, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.22433899343013763, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.809511125087738, "runtime_cat": 17.845, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.705", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999963898202938", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "seem familiar oneshot approach tackle kinship problemin notebook going solve kinship problem using popular oneshot learning approach build embedding generator find cosinesimilarity amongst image people family playing cosine similarity going design model able recognize people family people related blood", "tags_descriptive": []}
