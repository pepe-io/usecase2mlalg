{"title": "GCloud, Ensembling & Learning Learning Rates", "description": "Guide to Google Cloud Training, Ensembling & Learning Learning RatesThe objectives of this kernel are to first provide a quick overview of the steps I followed to set up virtual machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform, to download the required competition files, to train the models, how I changed the parameters to obtain the public score of <0.45, and also how to leave the instance running upon exiting the terminal. In particular, this will be my last public kernel (with scores) until the competition ends. The end of the competition is in about a month, and I figured that some insights on the tweeks to the existing training scripts could help those who have yet to make some sort of breakthrough at this point.
