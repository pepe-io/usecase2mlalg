{"title": "Basic Pure Computer Vision Segmentation (LB 0.229)", "description": "In this Kernel, I'd like to show you a very basic segmentation technique whihc only applies pure computer vision techniques. Nothing fancy. At first, I'll show the step-by-step processing and after that I will create the submission for the competition. With this kernel, I could reach 0.229 LB which is not very nice but I am sure that with a few tweaks we could get better score. And consider that we don't even use the train data! which is pretty awesome in my opinion.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/gaborvecsei/basic-pure-computer-vision-segmentation-lb-0-229", "tags": ["CV", "Biology"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-01-20 12:53:34", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:38:54", "words": 84, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.003177850740030408, "description_category_runtime": 8.092, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.0032931335736066103, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.607, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.003177850740030408, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.0032931335736066103, "runtime_cat": 20.7, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.749", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999983958824745", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel id like show basic segmentation technique whihc applies pure computer vision technique nothing fancy first ill show stepbystep processing create submission competition kernel could reach 0229 lb nice sure tweak could get better score consider dont even use train data pretty awesome opinion", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)", "Biology"]}
