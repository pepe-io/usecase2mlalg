{"title": "Improving masks; creating borders between objects", "description": "This quick bit of code could help improve the quality of the masks.Here, we ultimately want to alter the masks to differentiate each object, such that there will be a 255 pixel border around discrete objects. Blobs of, for example, cars, will be broken into individual cars.Any pixel not completely surrounded by pixels of the same label gets marked as a boundary. Boundaries are 2 pixels thick.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mattobrien415/improving-masks-creating-borders-between-objects", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-05-11 03:57:36", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:34:37", "words": 67, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.213403582572937, "description_category_runtime": 6.669, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7622119784355164, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.186, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.213403582572937, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.7622119784355164, "runtime_cat": 16.855, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.633", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978874017967", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "quick bit code could help improve quality maskshere ultimately want alter mask differentiate object 255 pixel border around discrete object blob example car broken individual carsany pixel completely surrounded pixel label get marked boundary boundary 2 pixel thick", "tags_descriptive": []}
