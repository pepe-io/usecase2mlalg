{"title": "Cloud Segmentation with utility scripts and Keras", "description": "Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images Cloud Segmentation with utility scripts and KerasThis kernel is to show the new feature on Kaggle, script notebooks. I'm not doing EDA here because I already did it on my other kernel, the goal here is just to demonstrate how to use script notebook and how it can improve our work, making it faster and cleaner.I found this addition really cool as I always try to write clean and modular code, it always saves time later, this may be another push towards better software practices on data science projects.What you will find on the script I made:  All used dependencies External repository codes (need internet option ON) Seed function (to make model runs more reproducible) Segmentation functions related to this competition Multi-thread data process functions (to resize and apply transformations faster) Model evaluation (training plots) Model post-process (Set threshold and removing small masks) Prediction evaluation (Generate metrics over predictions and sample evaluation) Data generator Learning rate schedulers  If you have any request to update or add anything to the scripts please let me know in the comments.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/dimitreoliveira/cloud-segmentation-with-utility-scripts-and-keras", "tags": ["DL", "CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-22 19:23:56", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:07:53", "words": 184, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.7575620412826538, "description_category_runtime": 15.55, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4254184365272522, "description_subcategory_runtime": 24.826, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.7575620412826538, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.4254184365272522, "runtime_cat": 40.375, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.728", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974616752731", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "understanding cloud satellite image cloud segmentation utility script kerasthis kernel show new feature kaggle script notebook im eda already kernel goal demonstrate use script notebook improve work making faster cleaneri found addition really cool always try write clean modular code always save time later may another push towards better software practice data science projectswhat find script made used dependency external repository code need internet option seed function make model run reproducible segmentation function related competition multithread data process function resize apply transformation faster model evaluation training plot model postprocess set threshold removing small mask prediction evaluation generate metric prediction sample evaluation data generator learning rate scheduler request update add anything script please let know comment", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
