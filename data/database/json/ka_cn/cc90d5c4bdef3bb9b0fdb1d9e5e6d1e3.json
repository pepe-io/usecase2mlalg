{"title": "Plates Leak Clear Visualization", "description": "See leak explanation in this post. RPE-03 and HUVEC-07 have the same pattern of controls, but not only\u2026 also the treatments are in the same pattern, only the plates are rotated. Now, there is an experiment in the test set that has the same pattern of controls\u2026 HUVEC-18. See images below to demonstrate what I said. Does HUVEC-18 also have the same pattern of treatments in some plate rotation?", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/giuliasavorgnan/plates-leak-clear-visualization", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-08-10 15:23:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:34:09", "words": 69, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Physics", "description_category_score": 0.6902406811714172, "description_category_runtime": 7.425, "description_subcategory": "Physical", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6644702553749084, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.358, "category": "Physics", "category_score": 0.6902406811714172, "subcategory": "Physical", "subcategory_score": 0.6644702553749084, "runtime_cat": 18.783, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.68", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978972320092", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "see leak explanation post rpe03 huvec07 pattern control also treatment pattern plate rotated experiment test set pattern control huvec18 see image demonstrate said huvec18 also pattern treatment plate rotation", "tags_descriptive": []}
