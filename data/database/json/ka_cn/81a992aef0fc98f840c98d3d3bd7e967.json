{"title": "VGG16+U-Net on Carvana", "description": "OverviewUsing a pretrained model to segmentHere is an example kernel where we use a pretrained VGG16 model as the encoder portion of a U-Net and thus can benefit from the features already created in the model and only focus on learning the specific decoding features. The strategy was used with LinkNet by one of the top placers in the competition. I wanted to see how well it worked in particular comparing it to standard or non-pretrained approaches, the code is setup now for VGG16 but can be easily adapted to other problems", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/vgg16-u-net-on-carvana", "tags": ["DL", "Transfer Learning", "CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-06-29 14:29:16", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:38:33", "words": 92, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.953325629234314, "description_category_runtime": 8.512, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9699163436889648, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.734, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.953325629234314, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9699163436889648, "runtime_cat": 21.246, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.762", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999981315008177", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewusing pretrained model segmenthere example kernel use pretrained vgg16 model encoder portion unet thus benefit feature already created model focus learning specific decoding feature strategy used linknet one top placer competition wanted see well worked particular comparing standard nonpretrained approach code setup vgg16 easily adapted problem", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Transfer Learning", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
