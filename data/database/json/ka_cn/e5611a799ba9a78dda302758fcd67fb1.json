{"title": "Simple Keras 1D CNN + features split", "description": "I've noticed that all types of features contain 64 samples. So it would be good to split them into different dimensions and after it we will have input shape (64, 3) for one sample. The simple network described below gives 96% - 98% (depends on random initialization) accuracy on validation set with size 0.1 and  0.05467 of score in Kaggle competition on test set.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/alexanderlazarev/simple-keras-1d-cnn-features-split", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-12-01 09:39:02", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:03:36", "words": 65, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.15857884287834167, "description_category_runtime": 6.953, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8081673979759216, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.743, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.15857884287834167, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8081673979759216, "runtime_cat": 17.695, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.797", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999994856749906", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "ive noticed type feature contain 64 sample would good split different dimension input shape 64 3 one sample simple network described give 96 98 depends random initialization accuracy validation set size 01 005467 score kaggle competition test set", "tags_descriptive": []}
