{"title": " Train With Crops -  CV 0.60+", "description": "Train on Crops - Predict on Full - CV 0.60+In this kernel we use a trick that we learned in Kaggle's Steel Competition. Since segmentation neural networks are all convolutions, you can train with one input size and predict with a different input size (explained in detail here). First we will resize all training and test images into size 700x1050 from their original 1400x2100. Next we will train with random 352x512 crops and then feed full test images (700x1050 images) into our network and get full segmentation masks!", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/train-with-crops-lb-0-63", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-31 04:36:40", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:07:53", "words": 88, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Agriculture", "description_category_score": 0.2750040888786316, "description_category_runtime": 9.089, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9733229279518127, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.829, "category": "Agriculture", "category_score": 0.2750040888786316, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9733229279518127, "runtime_cat": 22.919, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.699", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984446210461", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "train crop predict full cv 060in kernel use trick learned kaggles steel competition since segmentation neural network convolution train one input size predict different input size explained detail first resize training test image size 700x1050 original 1400x2100 next train random 352x512 crop feed full test image 700x1050 image network get full segmentation mask", "tags_descriptive": []}
