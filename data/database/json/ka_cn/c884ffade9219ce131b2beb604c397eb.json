First of allThis kernel is the tutorial to explore and visualize datasets and train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on keras. I'm not good at English. So, please post a comment if there are any unknown points:) Additionally, this kernel is unfinished, still writing. I will do my best! This kernel is getting better little by little.
