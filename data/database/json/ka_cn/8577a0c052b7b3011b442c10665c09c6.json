{"title": "~Almost~ complete Feature Engineering IEEE data", "description": "Feature Engineering~Almost~ all features of IEEE fraud detectetion datasetPurpose of the kernel:In the last week I worked in all features trying to improve my model. I've worked in almost all features and I decided to share with the kaggle fellows. NOTE: Maybe not all features could be useful, but I think that this work could help other kagglers in Data manipulation or to create another interesting feature", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kabure/almost-complete-feature-engineering-ieee-data", "tags": ["Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-08-08 03:28:43", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 21:40:28", "words": 67, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.0030855927616357803, "description_category_runtime": 6.924, "description_subcategory": "Fraud", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9791385531425476, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.512, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.0030855927616357803, "subcategory": "Fraud", "subcategory_score": 0.9791385531425476, "runtime_cat": 17.436, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.744", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958392791681", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "feature engineeringalmost feature ieee fraud detectetion datasetpurpose kernelin last week worked feature trying improve model ive worked almost feature decided share kaggle fellow note maybe feature could useful think work could help kagglers data manipulation create another interesting feature", "tags_descriptive": ["Feature Engineering"]}
