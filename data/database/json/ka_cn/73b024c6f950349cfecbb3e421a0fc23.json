{"title": "TF Hub Inception Resnet", "description": "This kernel is based on pre-trained TF model from the Tensorflow Hub. The kernel was inspired by Vikram's Kernel and xhlulu Kernel. How to get predictions ?I have used Inception-ResNet. This means that the inference will be slower, but the accuracy is better as compared to MobileNet v2. If you are using Kaggle Kernels split the image id's into bunch of 25000 and run the kernels 4 times if you get error code 137.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/akashdeepjassal/tf-hub-inception-resnet", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-07-23 07:39:51", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:41:47", "words": 74, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.15452691912651062, "description_category_runtime": 7.828, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9502575993537903, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.058, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.15452691912651062, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9502575993537903, "runtime_cat": 19.888, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.616", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999973498342167", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel based pretrained tf model tensorflow hub kernel inspired vikrams kernel xhlulu kernel get prediction used inceptionresnet mean inference slower accuracy better compared mobilenet v2 using kaggle kernel split image id bunch 25000 run kernel 4 time get error code 137", "tags_descriptive": []}
