{"title": "ASHRAE: Training LGBM by meter type", "description": "ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor IIIOur aim in this competition is to predict energy consumption of buildings. There are 4 types of energy to predict:  0: electricity 1: chilledwater 2: steam 3: hotwater  Electricity and water consumption may have different behavior! So I tried to separately train & predict the model. I moved previous ASHRAE: Simple LGBM submission kernel. [Update] I published \"Optuna tutorial for hyperparameter optimization\" notebook. Please also check it :)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/corochann/ashrae-training-lgbm-by-meter-type", "tags": ["Gradient Boosting", "Ensembling", "Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-28 14:31:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:41:48", "words": 75, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.08441794663667679, "description_category_runtime": 8.263, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.36241859197616577, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.505, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.08441794663667679, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.36241859197616577, "runtime_cat": 20.768, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.778", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958419840594", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "ashrae great energy predictor iiiour aim competition predict energy consumption building 4 type energy predict 0 electricity 1 chilledwater 2 steam 3 hotwater electricity water consumption may different behavior tried separately train predict model moved previous ashrae simple lgbm submission kernel update published optuna tutorial hyperparameter optimization notebook please also check", "tags_descriptive": ["Gradient Boosting", "Ensembling", "Feature Engineering"]}
