{"title": "Reducing Image Sizes to 32x32", "description": "Reducing Image Sizes to 32x32I think that some of you will be interested in trying smaller models to get started (e.g. a CNN with only a few connected layers). However, those datasets seem to be really big (150k test images and 195k training images) as well as high resolution. Just trying to create a GPU kernel and preprocessing the images seem to take a while. Therefore, I created this kernel in order to reduce the image to the smallest usable size (i.e. 32x32, similar to CIFAR10/100). Please feel free to use this as an output to your exploration models, or to modify this for other image sizes. Let me know your thoughts!
