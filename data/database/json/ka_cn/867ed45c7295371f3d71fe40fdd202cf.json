{"title": "Visualizing batch effects with t-SNE", "description": "Visualizing batch effects with t-SNE.I tried to visualize inherent batch effects of the data with t-SNE. Since each image is a 512*512*6 = 1572864-dimensional vector, separately using all of the pixels as an element of a vector makes t-SNE computation too intensive. To overcome it, I simply took average of the pixel intensities for each of the six channels given for an image, therefore handled a six-dimensional vector for each image. Another thing to note is that as the objective of this kernel is to visualize the batch effects, I only exploited positive and negative control-images to exclude siRNA-related effects.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/apap950419/visualizing-batch-effects-with-t-sne", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-07-14 16:57:10", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:34:09", "words": 100, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.3785436153411865, "description_category_runtime": 10.052, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5236272811889648, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.2, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.3785436153411865, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.5236272811889648, "runtime_cat": 25.253, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.648", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999987964229717", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "visualizing batch effect tsnei tried visualize inherent batch effect data tsne since image 5125126 1572864dimensional vector separately using pixel element vector make tsne computation intensive overcome simply took average pixel intensity six channel given image therefore handled sixdimensional vector image another thing note objective kernel visualize batch effect exploited positive negative controlimages exclude sirnarelated effect", "tags_descriptive": []}
