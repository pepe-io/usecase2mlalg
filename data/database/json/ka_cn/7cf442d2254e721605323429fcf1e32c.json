The idea is straightforward: if you have THREE cities in the path that are 'close' (in distance terms) to each other you can try to split the path by them and try different permutations of resulting chunks hoping that the decrease of the total penalty in this part of the path will be greater than the increase of the length caused by the permutation itself. Also instead of just permutating the chunks of the path you can  try to revert the order of some chunks but I won't do it in this kernel.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kostyaatarik/not-a-3-and-3-halves-opt", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-01-13 19:11:28", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:50:09", "words": 107, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.12922075390815735, "description_category_runtime": 9.312, "description_subcategory": "Transportation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2579108774662018, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.177, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.12922075390815735, "subcategory": "Transportation", "subcategory_score": 0.2579108774662018, "runtime_cat": 23.49, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.705", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999966313701393", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "im going share yet another simple working tsp solution optimization technique idea straightforward three city path close distance term try split path try different permutation resulting chunk hoping decrease total penalty part path greater increase length caused permutation also instead permutating chunk path try revert order chunk wont kernel", "tags_descriptive": []}
