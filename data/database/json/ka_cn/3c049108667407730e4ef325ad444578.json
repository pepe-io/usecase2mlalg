{"title": "A Comprehensive Guide to Transfer Learning", "description": "A Comprehensive Guide to Transfer LearningIn this kernel I have demonstrated the general techniques that can be used with Transfer Learning. For this kernel I have used the Flower Recognition dataset but the basic TL principles remains the same. Basically , you need to watch two things 1) The simalarity of your dataset with that of the pre-trained model and  2) The amount of the data that you have. Depending on these two conditions you can choose to either fine tune the weights or just train a classifier on top of the pre-trained model.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/rajmehra03/a-comprehensive-guide-to-transfer-learning", "tags": ["Transfer Learning", "CNN", "CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-16 08:56:01", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:58:25", "words": 95, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.00245094858109951, "description_category_runtime": 8.441, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9926742911338806, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.959, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.00245094858109951, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9926742911338806, "runtime_cat": 21.4, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.769", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967261271002", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "comprehensive guide transfer learningin kernel demonstrated general technique used transfer learning kernel used flower recognition dataset basic tl principle remains basically need watch two thing 1 simalarity dataset pretrained model 2 amount data depending two condition choose either fine tune weight train classifier top pretrained model", "tags_descriptive": ["Transfer Learning", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
