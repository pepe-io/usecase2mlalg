{"title": "Seedling Classification using CNN(V13 - 0.95)", "description": "Plant Seedling Classification using Convolutional Neural NetworksThis dataset consists of a training set and a testing set of images of plant seedlings at various growth stages. Each image has its own unique ID. The dataset has 12 main plant species which we need to classify the testing set into.  For this task we will need to process and clean the data using image processing Then we will have to build a model and evaluate it.
