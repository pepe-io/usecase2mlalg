{"title": "Reconstruction of 'ps_reg_03'", "description": "Reconstruction of 'ps_reg_03'Considering, that ps_reg_03 appears to be one of the most (if not the most) predictive feature in the data set, determining how it is constructed could be an important step in building very predictive new features and improving models. The closed form guesser of Wolfram|Alpha, applied to some high precision values of ps_reg_03 reveals the following pattern: ps_reg_03=\u221aI40,\u00a0with\u00a0I\u2208N+. In other words: I=(40\u2217ps_reg_03)2 yields an integer. ps_reg_03 is therefore likely a categorical feature or a combination of combinatorical features.
