{"title": "CNN + LSTM for Signal Classification LB 0.513", "description": "This is my first kernel on Kaggle. I am very excited to contribute to this competition and going back to my days of studying biomechatonics where I first met the concept of feature extraction to classify signals from sensors on human body. I made a fast literature review on feature extraction and signal classification and prepared following experiment for my first submissions. I will be updating explanatory walktrough alongside model improvements. Running and submitting from full notebook on interactive session was problemmatic due to memory troubles with the test set. I will work my way around it meanwhile you can download to use or fork to improve. Open for feedbacks to improve my first kernel. Have fun everyone!", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/afajohn/cnn-lstm-for-signal-classification-lb-0-513", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-01-09 18:01:24", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:09:07", "words": 118, "sentences": 8, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "description_category_score": 0.2286766916513443, "description_category_runtime": 9.956, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.852230429649353, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.359, "category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "category_score": 0.2286766916513443, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.852230429649353, "runtime_cat": 25.314, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.769", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974531238935", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "first kernel kaggle excited contribute competition going back day studying biomechatonics first met concept feature extraction classify signal sensor human body made fast literature review feature extraction signal classification prepared following experiment first submission updating explanatory walktrough alongside model improvement running submitting full notebook interactive session problemmatic due memory trouble test set work way around meanwhile download use fork improve open feedback improve first kernel fun everyone", "tags_descriptive": []}
