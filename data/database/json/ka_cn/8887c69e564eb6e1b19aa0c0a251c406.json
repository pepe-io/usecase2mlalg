{"title": "Demo: Cython generator and Keras CNN", "description": "This notebook is taken from the excellent notebook by @ptyshevs, cnn_v2. That notebook was created for the previous challenge. My changes here were only what is needed to produce a result for the new challenge. A demonstration, if you will. The first part of the notebook uses cython to generate sample games. The NN is then trained on these samples. The given training set isn't used at all!", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/demo-cython-generator-and-keras-cnn", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-02 17:16:02", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:58:02", "words": 68, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.0021426486782729626, "description_category_runtime": 7.276, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.04662768170237541, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.844, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.0021426486782729626, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.04662768170237541, "runtime_cat": 18.121, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.62", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967035759093", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook taken excellent notebook ptyshevs cnn_v2 notebook created previous challenge change needed produce result new challenge demonstration first part notebook us cython generate sample game nn trained sample given training set isnt used", "tags_descriptive": []}
