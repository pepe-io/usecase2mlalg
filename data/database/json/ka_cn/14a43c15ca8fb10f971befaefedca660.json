{"title": "Drugs MoA classification: EDA", "description": "Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction: EDA Image credit: https://www.labiotech.eu/cancer/forx-therapeutics-cancer-treatment/ In this competition, we are suposed to develop algorithms and train models to determine the mechanism of action of a new drug based on the gene expression and cell viability information. In this EDA, we will try to find patterns in the data, interactions between the targets in both scored and nonscored datasets and the relationship between targets and their target genes.
