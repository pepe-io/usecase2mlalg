{"title": "Basic Starter Kernel - NCAA Women's Dataset", "description": "OverviewThis is a starter notebook inspired by last year's Logistic Regression on Tournament Seeds by Kasper P. Lauritzen starter kernel. It creates a basic logistic regression model based on the seed differences between teams. Note that the predictions for Stage 1's sample submissions file are already based on known outcomes, and the Tourney data this model is trained on includes that data. For Stage 2, you will be predicting future outcomes based on the teams selected for the tournament on March 12.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/juliaelliott/basic-starter-kernel-ncaa-women-s-dataset", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-02-13 01:11:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:26:55", "words": 82, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.16728152334690094, "description_category_runtime": 7.797, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5091914534568787, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.038, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.16728152334690094, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.5091914534568787, "runtime_cat": 19.834, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.73", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999976802510568", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewthis starter notebook inspired last year logistic regression tournament seed kasper p lauritzen starter kernel creates basic logistic regression model based seed difference team note prediction stage 1 sample submission file already based known outcome tourney data model trained includes data stage 2 predicting future outcome based team selected tournament march 12", "tags_descriptive": []}
