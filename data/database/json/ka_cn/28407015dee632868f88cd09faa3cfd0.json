{"title": "Word2Vec for products analysis + 0.01 LB", "description": "Word2Vec on Instacart productsThe goal of this kernel is to try a Word2Vec model on the data of product ordersThe orders can act as sentences and product ids can act as words, in this kernel we will see if the model will learn any useful information about the products from the order history of all users, maybe in the future this can be used as input to a classifier that recommends products.This gave me a slight increase in my LB score, so it's a useful featurePlease upvote if you like it and let me know in the discussion if you have any remarks/ideasI also further explain the kernel in a blog post: http://omarito.me/word2vec-product-recommendations/", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/omarito/word2vec-for-products-analysis-0-01-lb", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "gensim"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-08-09 18:49:05", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 11:49:56", "words": 113, "sentences": 1, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.282229483127594, "description_category_runtime": 11.28, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5463741421699524, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.231, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.282229483127594, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5463741421699524, "runtime_cat": 28.512, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.763", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977164408007", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "word2vec instacart productsthe goal kernel try word2vec model data product ordersthe order act sentence product id act word kernel see model learn useful information product order history user maybe future used input classifier recommends productsthis gave slight increase lb score useful featureplease upvote like let know discussion remarksideasi also explain kernel blog post httpomaritomeword2vecproductrecommendations", "tags_descriptive": []}
