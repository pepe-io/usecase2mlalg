Why small datasets lead to overfitting? Use simple models Beware the outliers Select the features Balance the dataset with synthetic samples (SMOTE) Combine models for the final submission References", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/rafjaa/dealing-with-very-small-datasets", "tags": ["Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-06 20:38:25", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 19:05:08", "words": 55, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.10674761235713959, "description_category_runtime": 5.784, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.3387399911880493, "description_subcategory_runtime": 8.678, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.10674761235713959, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.3387399911880493, "runtime_cat": 14.462, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.802", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999976241796493", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "dealing small datasetsin kernel see technique handle small datasets main challenge avoid overfitting small datasets lead overfitting use simple model beware outlier select feature balance dataset synthetic sample smote combine model final submission reference", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification"]}
