{"title": "using_classification_for_predictions", "description": "IntroductionI believe the main issue we have in this challenge is not to predict revenues but more to get these zeros right since less than 1.3 % of the sessions have a non-zero revenue. The idea in this kernel is to classify non-zero transactions first and use that to help our regressor get better results. The kernel only presents one way of doing it. No special feature engineering or set of hyperparameters, just a code shell/structure ;-)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/ogrellier/using-classification-for-predictions", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-10-05 17:37:42", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:08:17", "words": 77, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.35455265641212463, "description_category_runtime": 7.482, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.262673944234848, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.636, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.35455265641212463, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.262673944234848, "runtime_cat": 19.119, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.744", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965543476519", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductioni believe main issue challenge predict revenue get zero right since le 13 session nonzero revenue idea kernel classify nonzero transaction first use help regressor get better result kernel present one way special feature engineering set hyperparameters code shellstructure", "tags_descriptive": []}
