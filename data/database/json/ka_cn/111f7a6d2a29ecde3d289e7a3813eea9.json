The idea behind these efforts is that attracting and retaining more women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will ultimately enhance innovation and creativity. When women are not involved in these fields, experiences, needs, and desires that are unique to women may be overlooked. It is not that there aren't any female role models out there to inspire us. Do you remember the iconic photograph of Katie Bouman in 2019, watching the black hole's first photograph as it was being reconstructed? Not only was it a breakthrough moment for the scientific community, but an equally proud one for all the women scientists all over the world. A historic moment not just for science, but for women in science, too.  Similarly, women have also been making significant contributions to the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science. Be it Margaret Hamilton or Grace Hopper in the past or Corinna Cortes and Fei Fei Li today; women have made their presence felt with their work. More and more girls are being motivated to take up science and research in school and colleges. A lot of companies today are coming forward to change the world of work. This year, even the United Nations celebrated International Women's Day under the official theme #BalanceforBetter, advocating a more gender-balanced world. However, as it may seem, not everything is still so \"gung-ho\" when it comes to women's representation is the Data Science field. The ratios are still skewed, and women still occupy far fewer leadership roles than men. But let's not just assume things but rather use data to verify our assumptions, and the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS survey is an excellent place to start. Let the numbers speak for themselves. ObjectiveThe objective of this notebook to analyze the survey data to answer an important question: is the women participation in STEM really improving, or is it just a hype? Let's use our analysis skills to investigate whether things seem to be actually improving or is still much left to be done. The Annual Kaggle\u00a0surveyKaggle's annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey is in its third year now. This year, as in 2017 and 2018, Kaggle has conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The Survey Challenges from 2017 and 2018 were very informative, and so is expected out of the 2019 survey too. MethodologyThis notebook will only focus on the women in ML and DS, thereby analyzing the answers of the female respondents solely. The analysis will be two-fold:  Analysis of the 2019 Kaggle DS & ML survey for Female respondents. Comparisons of the results in the 2019 study with the previous two surveys. This will present a better picture and show whether are things are improving for real or not.  In this notebook, we shall analyze the female participation in the survey under six different categories, namely:  Analyzing data under these different categories should give us a fair idea of the nature of women's representation is the ML and DS realm.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/geek-girls-rising-myth-or-reality", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project",
