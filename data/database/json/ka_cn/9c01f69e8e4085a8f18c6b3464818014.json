{"title": "Training Cellular Automata Part I: Game of Life", "description": "arseny-n showed us that Cellular Automata can be used as a language for solving ARC challenges, and provided us with a few example solutions. In this notebook we'll explore how we can use neural networks to create cellular automata. We'll start with Conway's Game of Life, and then move on to see if we can replicate his results using learned cellular automata. (See part II).", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/teddykoker/training-cellular-automata-part-i-game-of-life", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-02-29 20:48:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:09:12", "words": 65, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.005166575312614441, "description_category_runtime": 6.711, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.10822459310293198, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.182, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.005166575312614441, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.10822459310293198, "runtime_cat": 16.893, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.696", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999949594387372", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "arsenyn showed u cellular automaton used language solving arc challenge provided u example solution notebook well explore use neural network create cellular automaton well start conways game life move see replicate result using learned cellular automaton see part ii", "tags_descriptive": []}
