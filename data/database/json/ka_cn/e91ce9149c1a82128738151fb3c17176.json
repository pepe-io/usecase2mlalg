{"title": "Feature extraction using period analysis", "description": "Light curve can tell you a lot about the type of variable object, especially when the object is periodic. This kernel is about to examine, how to extract additional features from the lightcurves using periodograms and phase curves. We will use scipy.signal.lobscargle which is something like fourier analysis for unevenly distributed data. Also known as Least-squares spectral analysis (LSSA).", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/rejpalcz/feature-extraction-using-period-analysis", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-11-02 11:20:54", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 15:38:22", "words": 59, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.004, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.12296023964881897, "description_category_runtime": 7.019, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.43869301676750183, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.666, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.12296023964881897, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.43869301676750183, "runtime_cat": 17.685, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.701", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968386713106", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "light curve tell lot type variable object especially object periodic kernel examine extract additional feature lightcurves using periodograms phase curve use scipysignallobscargle something like fourier analysis unevenly distributed data also known leastsquares spectral analysis lssa", "tags_descriptive": []}
