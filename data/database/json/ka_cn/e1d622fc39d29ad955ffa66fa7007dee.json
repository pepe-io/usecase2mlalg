{"title": "Demythifying Matthew Correlation Coefficients (MCC", "description": "Introduction - 2nd EditionThe original purpose of this notebook is to understand Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC), especially in the context of VSB competition (If you are a VSB competitor wanting to visit the old note book, please see Section Introduction -- 1st Edition, below). However, after the competition ended, I seemed to be able to understand MCC in a more general sense. I was able to derive the MCC formula into an intuitive form which will benefit all other future usages. Therefore, I decide to revise this notebook, and hence here's 2nd Edition part.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/ratthachat/demythifying-matthew-correlation-coefficients-mcc", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-04-28 17:49:11", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:09:07", "words": 94, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.24110838770866394, "description_category_runtime": 9.077, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9496223330497742, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.02, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.24110838770866394, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9496223330497742, "runtime_cat": 23.097, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.741", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999980510677754", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introduction 2nd editionthe original purpose notebook understand matthew correlation coefficient mcc especially context vsb competition vsb competitor wanting visit old note book please see section introduction 1st edition however competition ended seemed able understand mcc general sense able derive mcc formula intuitive form benefit future usage therefore decide revise notebook hence here 2nd edition part", "tags_descriptive": []}
