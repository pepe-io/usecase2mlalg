In this kernel, I will look into the raw data structures and l5kit library in more detail with code reading. After understanding these, I hope you can arrange the data by yourself to build a better pipleline for motion prediction. Table of Contents 1. Understanding Rasterizer class   2. Understanding EgoDataset/AgentDataset class   3. Understanding raw data structures  The first part is same with previous kernel, please jump to 1. Understanding Rasterizer class for the main topic of this kernel.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/corochann/lyft-deep-into-the-l5kit-library", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Automotive"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-08 00:39:15", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:21:25", "words": 107, "sentences": 8, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.3025112748146057, "description_category_runtime": 11.285, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5278444886207581, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.513, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.3025112748146057, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5278444886207581, "runtime_cat": 28.798, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.737", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999976271824369", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "lyft deep l5kit library image l5kit official document httpwwwl5kitorgreadmehtml continued previous kernel lyft comprehensive guide start competition kernel look raw data structure l5kit library detail code reading understanding hope arrange data build better pipleline motion prediction table content 1 understanding rasterizer class 2 understanding egodatasetagentdataset class 3 understanding raw data structure first part previous kernel please jump 1 understanding rasterizer class main topic kernel", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Automotive"]}
