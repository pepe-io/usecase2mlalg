We will be exploring the data using Pandas and building models using ARIMA, tensorflow's DNN regressor, and xgboost. Let's get started! NOTEThis is my first competition and I'm still learning the models myself. At the end I share what I learned while building this.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/enolac5/time-series-arima-dnn-xgboost-comparison", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["xgboost", "tensorflow", "statsmodels"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-09-18 22:22:59", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:46:39", "words": 73, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.5648492574691772, "description_category_runtime": 7.569, "description_subcategory": "Retail", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8713390827178955, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.534, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.5648492574691772, "subcategory": "Retail", "subcategory_score": 0.8713390827178955, "runtime_cat": 19.102, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.759", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999941816422844", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "forecasting 3 month salesgiven 5 year daily sale data across 10 store 50 item tasked forecast next 3 month sale exploring data using panda building model using arima tensorflows dnn regressor xgboost let get started notethis first competition im still learning model end share learned building", "tags_descriptive": []}
