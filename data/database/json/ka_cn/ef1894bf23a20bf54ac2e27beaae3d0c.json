{"title": "RSNA-STR-PE [Gradient & Sigmoid Windowing]", "description": "Gradient & Sigmoid WindowingI've been exploring a bunch of different ways to window the DICOM images and I thought I'd share a few ideas and results. Huge thanks to David Tang, Marco, Nanashi, Richard McKinley and Ryan Epp for their amazing Kernels that I totally borrowed code and ideas from. Though the original notebook and idea of gradient and sigmoid windowing was applied for RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Challenge, in my view these techniques can put serious impact on the competition's LB.
