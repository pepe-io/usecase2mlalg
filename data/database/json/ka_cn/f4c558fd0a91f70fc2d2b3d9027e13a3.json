{"title": "Robot sensor EDA, FE and Prediction Improvement", "description": "Introduction:Robots are smart\u2026 by design. To fully understand and properly navigate a task, however, they need input about their environment. In this competition, you\u2019ll help robots recognize the floor surface they\u2019re standing on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors). About Data:CareerCon has collected IMU sensor data while driving a small mobile robot over different floor surfaces on the university premises. Objective:The task is to predict which one of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete) the robot is on using sensor data such as acceleration and velocity. Succeed and you'll help improve the navigation of robots without assistance across many different surfaces, so they won\u2019t fall down on the job.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/hiralmshah/robot-sensor-eda-fe-and-prediction-improvement", "tags": ["Classification", "Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-04-17 15:23:17", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:33:04", "words": 113, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.2888318598270416, "description_category_runtime": 11.394, "description_subcategory": "Physical", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6026078462600708, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.484, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.2888318598270416, "subcategory": "Physical", "subcategory_score": 0.6026078462600708, "runtime_cat": 28.879, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.73", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984593470643", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionrobots smart design fully understand properly navigate task however need input environment competition youll help robot recognize floor surface theyre standing using data collected inertial measurement unit imu sensor datacareercon collected imu sensor data driving small mobile robot different floor surface university premise objectivethe task predict one nine floor type carpet tile concrete robot using sensor data acceleration velocity succeed youll help improve navigation robot without assistance across many different surface wont fall job", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
