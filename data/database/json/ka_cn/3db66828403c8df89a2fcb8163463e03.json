{"title": "Earthquakes FE. More features and samples", "description": "General informationCorrectly predicting earthquakes is very important for preventing deaths and damage to infrastructure. In this competition we try to predict time left to the next laboratory earthquake based on seismic signal data. Training data represents one huge signal, but in test data we have many separate chunks, for each of which we need to predict time to failure. This is my second kernel for this competition, here is the link to the first one. In this kernel I'll try to create more useful features and generate more data for training.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/earthquakes-fe-more-features-and-samples", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering", "Regression"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-04-23 10:17:25", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:01:16", "words": 91, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Emergency & Relief", "description_category_score": 0.12612585723400116, "description_category_runtime": 7.937, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9693869948387146, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.413, "category": "Emergency & Relief", "category_score": 0.12612585723400116, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9693869948387146, "runtime_cat": 20.35, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.807", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958803807765", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general informationcorrectly predicting earthquake important preventing death damage infrastructure competition try predict time left next laboratory earthquake based seismic signal data training data represents one huge signal test data many separate chunk need predict time failure second kernel competition link first one kernel ill try create useful feature generate data training", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering", "Regression"]}
