In this project, our task is to help robots recognize the floor surface they\u2019re standing on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors). Hope you guys will learn something from this sensor data. Its kind of IOT data, as in IOT, we usually work with sensor data.. Its a golden chance to help humanity, by helping Robots !", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/prashantkikani/help-humanity-by-helping-robots", "tags": ["Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-17 06:01:54", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:33:04", "words": 76, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.24338482320308685, "description_category_runtime": 7.716, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9968919157981873, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.871, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.24338482320308685, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9968919157981873, "runtime_cat": 19.586, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.723", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999962394477794", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "robot smart design make robot smart machine learning guy project task help robot recognize floor surface theyre standing using data collected inertial measurement unit imu sensor hope guy learn something sensor data kind iot data iot usually work sensor data golden chance help humanity helping robot", "tags_descriptive": ["Feature Engineering"]}
