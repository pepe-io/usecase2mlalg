{"title": "Transfer learning with VGG-16", "description": "Kernel description: This kernel demonstrates application of transfer learning with VGG-16 to the given whale multi-class classfication problem. Please note that this is a solution to my university course assignment which differs in the objective from the original stated problem. The difference is that the original training data set is filtered by removing all whale individuals for which the number of images is smaller than the given threshold NUM_IMAGES_THRESHOLD. Also, all pictures annotated with 'new whale' label are excluded from the dataset. Last, there is no submission file produced by this kernel. Anyway, please consider upvoting this kernel if you liked it! PS.
