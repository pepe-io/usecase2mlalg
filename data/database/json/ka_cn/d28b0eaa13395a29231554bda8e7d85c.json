{"title": "Validation Strategy", "description": "Leaderboard Distribution I have been doing this competetion for 4 days or so. The main problem that everybody is (including me hitting my head through the WALL) facing is the local cross validation is not matching the LeaderBoard. In this kernel I try to create a Validation Set which matches the leaderboard using LeaderBoard Probing done by @donkeys and @ninoko.
