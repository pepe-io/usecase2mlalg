{"title": "SchNet Starter Kit", "description": "IntroductionI share a simple example which employ SchNet for predicting coupling constants. I hope this kernel helps beginners of DNN and will be used as a starter kit. The core idea is same as Heng's, which employ GNN as a feature exstractor. Two feature vectors are concatenated and thrown into regression header. More details of his idea and discussions can be read in below pages.  Which graph CNN is the best (with starter kit at LB -1.469)?https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/discussion/93972#latest-591759  Due to the limitation of Kaggle kernel, the model in not trained completely in this Kernel. You would achieve better score by continuing training procedure longer.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/toshik/schnet-starter-kit", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-08-17 13:30:11", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:53:35", "words": 105, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.07790558785200119, "description_category_runtime": 11.725, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9097091555595398, "description_subcategory_runtime": 18.381, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.07790558785200119, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9097091555595398, "runtime_cat": 30.106, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.728", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999970704098101", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductioni share simple example employ schnet predicting coupling constant hope kernel help beginner dnn used starter kit core idea hengs employ gnn feature exstractor two feature vector concatenated thrown regression header detail idea discussion read page graph cnn best starter kit lb 1469httpswwwkagglecomcchampsscalarcouplingdiscussion93972latest591759 due limitation kaggle kernel model trained completely kernel would achieve better score continuing training procedure longer", "tags_descriptive": []}
