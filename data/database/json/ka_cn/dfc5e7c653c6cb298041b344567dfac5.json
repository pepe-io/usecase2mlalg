{"title": "Prostate Cancer: In Depth Understanding,EDA ,Model", "description": "About this NotebookI have always seen that Kaggle competitions require a lot of domain knowledge and the main problems of a Kaggle beginner is not lack of Machine learning Knowledge but more often than not it is lack of domain knowledge.There are always a lot of great kernels regarding different ways of solving the problems but only a few handful address the problems of domain knowledge and getting started. In this notebook , I will start with complete explanation of everything you need know related to Prostate Cancer and its detection and I will built on that to explain the dataset,perform EDA and then Build a baseline model This kernel will be a work in Progress,and I will keep on updating it as the competition progresses and I learn more and more things about the data If you find this kernel useful, Please consider Upvoting it , it motivates me to write more Quality content", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077/prostate-cancer-in-depth-understanding-eda-model", "tags": ["CV", "Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-04-27 13:59:01", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:03:25", "words": 155, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.030756432563066483, "description_category_runtime": 12.656, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9283145666122437, "description_subcategory_runtime": 19.903, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.030756432563066483, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.9283145666122437, "runtime_cat": 32.56, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.749", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999970547962489", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebooki always seen kaggle competition require lot domain knowledge main problem kaggle beginner lack machine learning knowledge often lack domain knowledgethere always lot great kernel regarding different way solving problem handful address problem domain knowledge getting started notebook start complete explanation everything need know related prostate cancer detection built explain datasetperform eda build baseline model kernel work progressand keep updating competition progress learn thing data find kernel useful please consider upvoting motivates write quality content", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)", "Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
