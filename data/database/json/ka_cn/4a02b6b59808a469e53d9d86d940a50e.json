{"title": " Pseudo-Labelled PolyLR and QDA ", "description": "Pseudo-Labelled PolyLR and QDAThis kernel shows the potential of adding quadratic polynomial features, a simple logistic regression can learn just like QDA. I also tested pseudo labelling and blending with QDA. Thanks to Chris's great kernels LR, SVC, probing, pseudo labelling and mhviraf's kernel make_classification which shows how the dataset was generated. Please also upvote those kernels.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/gogo827jz/pseudo-labelled-polylr-and-qda", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-06-11 12:24:29", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 11:53:26", "words": 57, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.30628326535224915, "description_category_runtime": 7.282, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8784600496292114, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.445, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.30628326535224915, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8784600496292114, "runtime_cat": 18.727, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.709", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974028845281", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "pseudolabelled polylr qdathis kernel show potential adding quadratic polynomial feature simple logistic regression learn like qda also tested pseudo labelling blending qda thanks chriss great kernel lr svc probing pseudo labelling mhvirafs kernel make_classification show dataset generated please also upvote kernel", "tags_descriptive": []}
