{"title": "A Faster Python Scoring Function", "description": "A Better Scoring FunctionInspired by this R scoring function from Vicens Gaitan I implemented a scoring function in Python.  On my machine it runs 3 times faster than the one from trackml package.  On Kalggle kernels it is about 4x faster than the trackml one. I reused part of this notebook as a starting point.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/cpmpml/a-faster-python-scoring-function", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-05-29 22:12:21", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:43:28", "words": 57, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "description_category_score": 0.3130679726600647, "description_category_runtime": 6.078, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.40466099977493286, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.176, "category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "category_score": 0.3130679726600647, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.40466099977493286, "runtime_cat": 15.255, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.696", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999952199940995", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "better scoring functioninspired r scoring function vicens gaitan implemented scoring function python machine run 3 time faster one trackml package kalggle kernel 4x faster trackml one reused part notebook starting point", "tags_descriptive": []}
