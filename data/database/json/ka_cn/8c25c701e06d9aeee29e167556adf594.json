{"title": "Exploratory AUDIO Analysis", "description": "Predicting Earthquakes?Predicting earthquakes has long been thought to be near-impossible. But same has been said about many other things, I still remember how 15 years ago my IT teacher in high school was saying that speech recognition can never be done reliably by a computer, and today it's more reliable than a human. So who knows, maybe this competition will be a major step in solving another \"impossible\" problem. Importance of predicting earthquakes is hard to underestimate - selected years of our century claimed hundreds of thousands of causalities. Being able to predict earthquakes could allow us to better protect human life and property.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/avloss/audio-analysis-with-animation", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-02-06 21:47:17", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:01:16", "words": 104, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Emergency & Relief", "description_category_score": 0.18043296039104462, "description_category_runtime": 9.482, "description_subcategory": "Physical", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6179996132850647, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.701, "category": "Emergency & Relief", "category_score": 0.18043296039104462, "subcategory": "Physical", "subcategory_score": 0.6179996132850647, "runtime_cat": 24.184, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.72", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999995450631112", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "predicting earthquakespredicting earthquake long thought nearimpossible said many thing still remember 15 year ago teacher high school saying speech recognition never done reliably computer today reliable human know maybe competition major step solving another impossible problem importance predicting earthquake hard underestimate selected year century claimed hundred thousand causality able predict earthquake could allow u better protect human life property", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
