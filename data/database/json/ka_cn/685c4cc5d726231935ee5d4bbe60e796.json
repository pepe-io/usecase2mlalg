{"title": "[TSE2020] RoBERTa (CNN) & Random Seed Distribution", "description": "OverviewAwhile ago, I chanced upon Chris Deotte's analysis at https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/discussion/142404#809872. Found it interesting and since I had GPU to spare while training my models offline, I tried to replicate the process with Think deep.'s work at https://www.kaggle.com/seesee/faster-2x-tf-roberta. After modifying the CNN head a bit (don't ask me why, its part of my experiments), and attempting to replicate Chris' findings, I arrived at the below results in the historgram plots. In summary, the changes are:  Modified CNN layers Varied seeds and performed repeated submissions and commits for same seeds", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/khoongweihao/tse2020-roberta-cnn-random-seed-distribution", "tags": ["NLP"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-23 08:35:34", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:53:52", "words": 89, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.17212748527526855, "description_category_runtime": 12.166, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9083901643753052, "description_subcategory_runtime": 18.593, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.17212748527526855, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9083901643753052, "runtime_cat": 30.76, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.769", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967630418629", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewawhile ago chanced upon chris deottes analysis httpswwwkagglecomctweetsentimentextractiondiscussion142404809872 found interesting since gpu spare training model offline tried replicate process think deep work httpswwwkagglecomseeseefaster2xtfroberta modifying cnn head bit dont ask part experiment attempting replicate chris finding arrived result historgram plot summary change modified cnn layer varied seed performed repeated submission commits seed", "tags_descriptive": ["Natural Language Processing (NLP)"]}
