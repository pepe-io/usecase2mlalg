{"title": "#1 Smart Robots. Complete Compilation ", "description": "CareerCon 2019 - Help Navigate RobotsTop Solutions Compilation  Robots are smart\u2026 by design. To fully understand and properly navigate a task, however, they need input about their environment. In this competition, you\u2019ll help robots recognize the floor surface they\u2019re standing on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors).  This is just a compilation of all the best solutions I have found, different types of analysis and posts (discussions). The purpose of this is to have in a single kernel all the relevant information/solutions of this competition, so that if in the future there is a similar competition this material can be used as baseline, and maybe the authors delete the kernel or make it private, so we would lose all that amazing information. Please comment bellow if you want me to add something, or if I missed something important... and please support the original kernels and their authors.  My best/original kernel in this competition is #1 Smart Robots.
