We have several files with additional features, which have information only for train and not for test. In this kernel I'll show how to create meta-features both train and test and use them.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/using-meta-features-to-improve-model", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-06-26 18:22:24", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:53:35", "words": 64, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.10110238939523697, "description_category_runtime": 6.414, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9854016304016113, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.715, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.10110238939523697, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9854016304016113, "runtime_cat": 16.129, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.766", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975698579591", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general informationthis kernel continuation previous kernel eda feature engineering kernel ill try use additional data provided train dataset several file additional feature information train test kernel ill show create metafeatures train test use", "tags_descriptive": []}
