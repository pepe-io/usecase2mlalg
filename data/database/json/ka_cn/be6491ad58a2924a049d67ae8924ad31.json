I just wanted to learn BERT and played around with the basics . The training was done in colab . If you want to use the Kernel for training , just change the last parameter to True in Pipeline Config . This was taken from Combat-Wombat team in Toxicity .", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/phoenix9032/pytorch-bert-plain", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pytorch", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-01-14 12:56:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:20:08", "words": 69, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.051921144127845764, "description_category_runtime": 6.583, "description_subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "description_subcategory_score": 0.07459855079650879, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.897, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.051921144127845764, "subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "subcategory_score": 0.07459855079650879, "runtime_cat": 16.48, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.735", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999969925599828", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "mostly copy aditya sonis kernel small change nothing complicated wanted learn bert played around basic training done colab want use kernel training change last parameter true pipeline config taken combatwombat team toxicity", "tags_descriptive": []}
