{"title": "getting-started", "description": "Who can identify whale species in images?In this competition, we are given a multilabel classification problem, which is basically a problem where we have to decide, given an image, which labels does it belong to? Our task is as follows: \"For each Image in the test set, you may predict up to 5 labels for the whale Id\"  In this notebook, we will:  Look at the actual images to get a first impression of the data Cluster the images according to their pixel intensities to find potentially formed groups Generate a baseline bernoulli sample submission  A standard approach to multilabel classification is to learn as many OVA (one vs all) models as there are distinct labels and then assign labels by the classifier output of each of the models, we'll get to that later.
