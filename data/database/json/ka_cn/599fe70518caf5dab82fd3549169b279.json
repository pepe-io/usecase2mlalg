{"title": "Visualizing Word Vectors with t-SNE", "description": "Visualizing Word Vectors with t-SNETSNE is pretty useful when it comes to visualizing similarity between objects. It works by taking a group of high-dimensional (100 dimensions via Word2Vec) vocabulary word feature vectors, then compresses them down to 2-dimensional x,y coordinate pairs. The idea is to keep similar words close together on the plane, while maximizing the distance between dissimilar words. Steps Clean the data Build a corpus Train a Word2Vec Model Visualize t-SNE representations of the most common words   Credit: Some of the code was inspired by this awesome NLP repo.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jeffd23/visualizing-word-vectors-with-t-sne", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "nltk", "vocabulary", "gensim"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-03-18 23:30:10", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:22:58", "words": 93, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.28570035099983215, "description_category_runtime": 9.845, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4213843047618866, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.85, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.28570035099983215, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.4213843047618866, "runtime_cat": 24.696, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.814", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999987048699666", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "visualizing word vector tsnetsne pretty useful come visualizing similarity object work taking group highdimensional 100 dimension via word2vec vocabulary word feature vector compress 2dimensional xy coordinate pair idea keep similar word close together plane maximizing distance dissimilar word step clean data build corpus train word2vec model visualize tsne representation common word credit code inspired awesome nlp repo", "tags_descriptive": []}
