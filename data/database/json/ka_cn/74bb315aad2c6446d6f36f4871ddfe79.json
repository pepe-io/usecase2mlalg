I am using the TPOT package to create a pipeline. TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. I thought it is useful to add this to the list of kernels available in this competition.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sheriytm/brewed-tpot-for-nyc-with-love-lb0-37", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "tpot"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-09-27 06:44:56", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:39:46", "words": 67, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.17724089324474335, "description_category_runtime": 6.479, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9831163287162781, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.658, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.17724089324474335, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9831163287162781, "runtime_cat": 16.138, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.727", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997173129906", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "new york city taxi trip duration notebook go simple process extracting basic feature building model make prediction using tpot package create pipeline tpot python automated machine learning tool optimizes machine learning pipeline using genetic programming thought useful add list kernel available competition", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering"]}
