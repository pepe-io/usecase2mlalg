{"title": "Recommendations with Collaborative Filtering", "description": "Given a professional, the goal is to return a list of questions sorted by the predicted likelihood of the professional answering the question. This can be treated like a recommendation problem with implicit feedback, where the professional is the user and the question is the item. A professional answering a question can be used as a form of implicit feedback. The  Implicit library is used  to implement a collaboritve filtering algorithm that is based on the method used in Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tagboola/recommendations-with-collaborative-filtering", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-12 01:29:06", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:41:32", "words": 87, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.25010013580322266, "description_category_runtime": 7.973, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.36756426095962524, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.166, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.25010013580322266, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.36756426095962524, "runtime_cat": 20.14, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.656", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999944116162368", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "given professional goal return list question sorted predicted likelihood professional answering question treated like recommendation problem implicit feedback professional user question item professional answering question used form implicit feedback implicit library used implement collaboritve filtering algorithm based method used collaborative filtering implicit feedback datasets", "tags_descriptive": []}
