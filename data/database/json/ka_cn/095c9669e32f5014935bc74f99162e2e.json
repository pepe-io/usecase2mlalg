{"title": "Tackling any Kaggle Competition : The Noob's Way", "description": "About this NotebookHello everyone , Its been long since I have written a detailed notebook in the way I love to and I was itching to do so. Kaggle competitions can be very intimidating at times given they not only need good machine learning skills but also heavy domain knowledge. People always ask me how and where to start with kaggle , how do I manage to do good in competitions which require heavy domain knowledge , What level of knowledge do we need before starting a Kaggle competition ,etc . This notebook is meant to answer all those questions and is specially for anyone who wants to start with live competitions but is overwhelmed by the shear amount of things that a live competitions bring to the table. I was thinking of writing this from a long time now , but I was waiting for the right competition and here we have it , \"good old tabular competition\" which is a rare sight at kaggle. So without any further delay if you want to get started with live kaggle competitions or want to do good in kaggle competitions or need a detailed pathway on approaching kaggle competitions,etc , be sure to stick with me till the end of this notebook as   This is a step by step guide on How to Tackle Any Kaggle Competition : The Noob's Way  Note :- This notebook is a part of my Series : Mr KnowNothing's Weekends , in which I have planned a lot of more things ,if you liked this notebook and are interested in more such content you can know more about the series and follow along here  Important Note : All the steps/advices which I give in this notebook are from my personal experience and contain methods which I personally use.  I still consider myself a Kaggle Noob who is trying to learn,hence everything which I write might not be the optimal way , its just a guide to help people, I request all Kagglers to correct me in the comments if they feel there might be a better approach for what I am following now . I would really appreciate views of other Kagglers      , Thanks", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077/tackling-any-kaggle-competition-the-noob-s-way", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Xgboost"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-10-29 05:22:40", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:16:12", "words": 378, "sentences": 8, "sum_nltk": "So without any further delay if you want to get started with live kaggle competitions or want to do good in kaggle competitions or need a detailed pathway on approaching kaggle competitions,etc , be sure to stick with me till the end of this notebook as   This is a step by step guide on How to Tackle Any Kaggle Competition : The Noob's Way  Note :- This notebook is a part of my Series : Mr KnowNothing's Weekends , in which I have planned a lot of more things ,if you liked this notebook and are interested in more such content you can know more about the series and follow along here  Important Note : All the steps/advices which I give in this notebook are from my personal experience and contain methods which I personally use.\nI still consider myself a Kaggle Noob who is trying to learn,hence everything which I write might not be the optimal way , its just a guide to help people, I request all Kagglers to correct me in the comments if they feel there might be a better approach for what I am following now .", "sum_nltk_words": 195, "sum_nltk_runtime": 0.003, "sum_t5": "this notebook is a step by step guide on how to tackle any kaggle competition. it is meant to answer all those questions and is specially for anyone who wants to start with live competitions. i still consider myself a Kaggle Noob who is trying to learn, hence everything which I write might not be the optimal way. i ask all Kagglers to correct me in the comments if they feel there might be a better approach for what i am following now.", "sum_t5_words": 83, "sum_t5_runtime": 6.691, "runtime": 0.004, "nltk_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "nltk_category_score": 0.03816182166337967, "nltk_category_runtime": 15.549, "nltk_subcategory": "Student", "nltk_subcategory_score": 0.4020475149154663, "nltk_subcategory_runtime": 24.91, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.03816182166337967, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.4020475149154663, "runtime_cat": 40.459, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.728", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999980023459505", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebookhello everyone long since written detailed notebook way love itching kaggle competition intimidating time given need good machine learning skill also heavy domain knowledge people always ask start kaggle manage good competition require heavy domain knowledge level knowledge need starting kaggle competition etc notebook meant answer question specially anyone want start live competition overwhelmed shear amount thing live competition bring table thinking writing long time waiting right competition good old tabular competition rare sight kaggle without delay want get started live kaggle competition want good kaggle competition need detailed pathway approaching kaggle competitionsetc sure stick till end notebook step step guide tackle kaggle competition noobs way note notebook part series mr knownothings weekend planned lot thing liked notebook interested content know series follow along important note stepsadvices give notebook personal experience contain method personally use still consider kaggle noob trying learnhence everything write might optimal way guide help people request kagglers correct comment feel might better approach following would really appreciate view kagglers thanks", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Xgboost"]}
