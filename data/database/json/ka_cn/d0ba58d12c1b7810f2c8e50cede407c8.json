Definition and III. Results sections before the II. Implementation.  ABSTRACTOur analysis aimed to define common features and specific trends among \"Cinderella\" teams in NCAA\u00ae men's basketball. In this context, Cinderella was defined as any basketball team seeded 10th or worse that has advanced to the Round 3 in NCAA\u00ae tournament. We have divided all the remaining teams into two more categories - Top and Ordinary. We explored, filtered and analyzed NCAA\u00ae data across different dimensions and used descriptive statistics and exploratory visualizations to summarize main characteristics about the data in general, and in particular about \"Cinderellaness\" as our target of interest. Our analysis demonstrated that a typical Cinderella team is ranked between 20 and 65 in a pre-tournament rankings of a popular ranking systems. Cinderellas are good at shooting 2-pointers in the regular season, but not so much in the tournaments. The opposite is true for the three-point goals - Cinderellas have the highest three-point field goal ratio in NCAA\u00ae tournaments of all team categories. Cinderellas are successful in defensive rebounding and will likely have a positive Rebound Margin in the regular season games. They typically win with a high scoring margin in Round 2 of NCAA\u00ae tournament, but it is harder for them to keep it as high in the later rounds. For this research, we have trained eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm to predict which team had the best potential to become a Cinderella before the March Madness was canceled. Our model predicted that ETSU (East Tennessee State University) was the most likely candidate for a Cinderella team of the 2020 season.  I. Definition1.1. Project OverviewProject Origin Each season there are thousands of men's and women's NCAA\u00ae basketball games played between Division I teams, culminating in March Madness\u00ae, the national championship tournaments that start in the middle of March [1]. The men's and women's NCAA basketball tournaments are beloved American sports traditions. These are single-elimination tournaments, which means that the championship team has to win at least six games in a row to claim the title. This high-stakes environment \u2014 plus the chance to witness a crazy \"Cinderella-story\" upset, gives the tournament its March Madness\u00ae nickname [4]. The challenge of the \"Google Cloud & NCAA\u00ae March Madness Analytics\" competition, sponsored by Google Cloud and hosted by Kaggle, is to present an exploratory analysis of the March Madness\u00ae using a Kaggle Notebook. Prerequisite Knowledge In this study, we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic NCAA\u00ae men's basketball rules and terminology. For those new to basketball, we recommend [4] and [26] for a quick introduction. Input Data The input NCAA\u00ae data is provided for this competition and is available from the competition website. The data is about college basketball games and teams and is divided into 6 sections - The Basics, Team Box Scores, Geography, Public Rankings, Play-by-play and Supplements. Please refer to the Data [1] section at the bottom of this notebook for a full description of each file. On March 12, 2020, NCAA\u00ae canceled the Division I men's and women's 2020 basketball tournaments, as well as all remaining winter and spring NCAA\u00ae championships based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat [2], so the 2020 data is incomplete and does not have an information about 2020 NCAA\u00ae tournament bracket. 1.2. Problem StatementThe goal of our project is to use data analysis to explain \"cinderellaness\" - define common features and specific trends among \"Cinderella\" teams in NCAA\u00ae men's basketball. The intended solution is to:  Define and filter out our target of interest - \"Cinderella\" teams Preprocess, filter and analyze input data Build visualizations to provide insights into the data & metrics Use machine learning to predict which team had the potential to become a Cinderella in a 2020 season Communicate the results of the analysis  1.3. MethodologyData Exploration and Preprocessing Scientific computing and analysis packages such as NumPy and Pandas will be used to explore and preprocess the data. Data cleaning will be performed where necessary. We will filter data across different categories, such as regular season vs. NCAA\u00ae tournament, all games vs. games won, team segment vs. metric vs. season. Data SegmentationThe essential part of our analysis is to divide men's NCAA\u00ae basketball teams into 3 groups - Cinderella, Top and Ordinary. A March Madness Cinderella is a team that greatly exceeds its NCAA\u00ae tournament expectations. They are generally afterthoughts on the Selection Sunday bracket, but wind up becoming one of the biggest stories of the tournament [3]. In NCAA\u00ae, the field of teams is divided into four geographical regions. Each region has between 16 and 18 teams, which are assigned a seed number of one through 18, with the best team in the region awarded the No. 1 seed. Traditionally, the highest seeds (Nos. 1 through 8) have enjoyed more success than the lower seeds (Nos. 9 through 16). The lower seeds represent potential Cinderellas of the tournament. A Cinderella team is one that unexpectedly achieves success in the tournament. Traditionally, Cinderella's chariot turns back into a pumpkin before getting to the Final Four [4] (also see Figure 1). Considering the above definition, we decided to use the following segmentation as the foundation for our discussion and analysis:  CINDERELLA - any basketball team seeded 10th or worse that has advanced to the Round 3 in NCAA\u00ae tournament. This group is our target of interest. TOP - top-seeded (Nos. 1 through 4) teams who have advanced to the Round 3 in NCAA\u00ae tournament. This group will represent the most competitive teams - teams that match expectations. ORDINARY - all the other NCAA\u00ae tournament teams not falling under two previous categories, for example seeded No 2. but lost in the first-round game. Note that all seed Nos. 5 through 9 will always fall under this category.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/evanca/uncovering-cinderellaness", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs":
