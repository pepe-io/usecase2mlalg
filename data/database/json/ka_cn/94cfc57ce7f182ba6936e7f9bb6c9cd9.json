{"title": "BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO MERCARI IN R - [0.50586]", "description": "BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO MERCARI IN R I'm writing what I believe is a fairly straight forward guide to my thought process through the Mercari challenge. Table of Contents: 1. Import library/datasets 2. Create obvious variables 3. Explore data to Find less obvious variables 4. Prepare the data for xgboost 5. Run an xgboost validation model 6. Analyze results For those who are feeling overwhelmed by the sheer size of this dataset, I recommend slicing 10% off and working on that section of the code. I'll post a quick way to do this. I'll be updating this kernel as I think of ways to improve the efficiency or score of my model.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jeremiespagnolo/beginner-s-guide-to-mercari-in-r-0-50586", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["xgboost", "Pillow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-17 16:32:07", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:05:42", "words": 111, "sentences": 10, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.21128115057945251, "description_category_runtime": 10.626, "description_subcategory": "Rental & Leasing", "description_subcategory_score": 0.20529907941818237, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.062, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.21128115057945251, "subcategory": "Rental & Leasing", "subcategory_score": 0.20529907941818237, "runtime_cat": 26.689, "programming_language": "R notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.749", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975747454084", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "beginner guide mercari r im writing believe fairly straight forward guide thought process mercari challenge table content 1 import librarydatasets 2 create obvious variable 3 explore data find le obvious variable 4 prepare data xgboost 5 run xgboost validation model 6 analyze result feeling overwhelmed sheer size dataset recommend slicing 10 working section code ill post quick way ill updating kernel think way improve efficiency score model", "tags_descriptive": []}
