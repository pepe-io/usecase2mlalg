{"title": "EloDA with Feature Engineering and  Stacking", "description": "OverviewThe purpose of this kernel is to take a look at the data, come up with some insights, and attempt to create a predictive model or two. This notebook is still very raw. I will work on it as my very limited time permits, and hope to expend it in the upcoming days and weeks. NB: Most of the feature engineering and some of the modeling is based on Peter Hurford's excellent kernel , and another one by Konrad Banachevitz. PackagesFirst, let's load a few useful Python packages. This section will keep growing in subsequent versions of this EDA.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/eloda-with-feature-engineering-and-stacking", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-12 03:44:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 19:19:32", "words": 99, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.198409765958786, "description_category_runtime": 9.157, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.49463292956352234, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.696, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.198409765958786, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.49463292956352234, "runtime_cat": 22.854, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.749", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999979072270162", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewthe purpose kernel take look data come insight attempt create predictive model two notebook still raw work limited time permit hope expend upcoming day week nb feature engineering modeling based peter hurfords excellent kernel another one konrad banachevitz packagesfirst let load useful python package section keep growing subsequent version eda", "tags_descriptive": []}
