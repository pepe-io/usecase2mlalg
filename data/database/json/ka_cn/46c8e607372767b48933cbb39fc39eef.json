{"title": "NFL 1st and Future - Analysis", "description": "NFL 1st and Future - Analytics By Ben Jenkins and Steve Jenkins Key Findings  We have verified that synthetic surfaces have a greater probability of injury.\u202f From the data provided, synthetic surfaces have approximately 1.8 times greater injury rate compared to natural surfaces  Injuries tend to be more severe on synthetic surfaces in terms of days missed, and injuries on synthetic turf tend to more dispersed across the field. This suggests that non-contact injuries may\u202fplay a larger role in synthetic compared to natural turf. Temperature plays a role in injuries. Low temperatures (10 degrees to 40 degrees) is a predictor of low injury rates. There are differences in speed and acceleration between the injured and non-injured population. The injured population has a higher average max speed and acceleration. For a given weight of player, greater acceleration would create more force (Force=Mass  times  Acceleration) and likelihood of injury.  Players tend to be injured early in the game. This tendency is more pronounced for natural playing surfaces compared to synthetic.\u202fEarly in the game players tend to run faster and may generate more force leading to increased injury rate.\u202fThere is a weak negative correlation between the number of plays a player participates in during a game, and their speed. The player location plays a role in injury incidence. A model was built to predict injuries based on the variables provided in the competition. The model's performance and findings are discussed in the presentation provided. The injury model suggests that there is a higher chance for injuries at low yardage (x axis is the long axis of field).  At high yardage, the model suggests that there is less chance for injury Recommendations for NFL  Substitute natural turf for synthetic turf. This analysis shows that this could significantly reduce the lower-limb injury incidence. Play in indoor stadiums. This allows the ability to control weather and temperature, which are shown to contribute to injuries. A variety of other factors considered in this analysis cannot be realistically addressed by the NFL, without drastic changes to the rules of the game.  We note that player speed, acceleration, number of plays, orientation and location on the field impact the probability of injury. Other factors not considered in this analysis such as type of footwear, padding, etc. may be useful to reduce injury Recommendations for Future Analysis  More data from lower-limb injuries is needed to allow the model to more accurately predict injury occurrence.  For example, collecting data on additional seasons would provide more information on injury trends. Higher quality data, such as helmet mounted accelerometers would likely improve injury prediction. Another key improvement to the model would be a detection of the exact time at which the injury occurred. This would allow analysis of the pre and post injury movements by the player. In some cases, the time of the injury may not be available.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/benjenkins96/nfl-1st-and-future-analysis", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-01-03 00:38:45", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:23:02", "words": 486, "sentences": 26, "sum_nltk": "NFL 1st and Future -
