{"title": "Open Images EDA", "description": "IntroThis notebook shows some characteristics of the images and labels used for the two contests. I've taken a small subset of training images and files from the Open Images dataset and put them here: Excerpt from OpenImages 2020 Train. Some specific objectives:  Get a feel for the the images and the objects/segments they contain. Implement some basic object detection. Look at label counts image sizes, and object relationships.  On the technical side, there are some things you might find useful:  Modeling with large datasets in Kaggle notebooks Making interactive plots with hvplot Visualizing graph networks with networkX", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/open-images-eda", "tags": ["CV", "Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-06-06 02:50:46", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:42:26", "words": 100, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.09095032513141632, "description_category_runtime": 9.265, "description_subcategory": "Restaurant", "description_subcategory_score": 0.13848014175891876, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.169, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.09095032513141632, "subcategory": "Restaurant", "subcategory_score": 0.13848014175891876, "runtime_cat": 23.435, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.754", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999969864586864", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introthis notebook show characteristic image label used two contest ive taken small subset training image file open image dataset put excerpt openimages 2020 train specific objective get feel image objectssegments contain implement basic object detection look label count image size object relationship technical side thing might find useful modeling large datasets kaggle notebook making interactive plot hvplot visualizing graph network networkx", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)", "Feature Engineering"]}
