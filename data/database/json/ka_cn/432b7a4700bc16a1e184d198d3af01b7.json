{"title": "Transfer Learning for Boat or No-Boat", "description": "OverviewRather than trying to segment, we start off by making a model that simply tries to identify if any boat shows up in the image.  For this model we can see roughly how it performs in the compititon by guessing the whole image (as an RLE) if any boat shows up (not a very smart startegy, but might provide some interesting results). BeyondThe model could also be useful as a quick way (low resolution images) to screen through lots of images to see if they are likely to have a boat and if they are then run a much more expensive full-resolution U-Net on that sample", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/transfer-learning-for-boat-or-no-boat", "tags": ["Transfer Learning"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-10-19 12:05:06", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:28:05", "words": 107, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.1868913471698761, "description_category_runtime": 9.578, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8661128282546997, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.717, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.1868913471698761, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8661128282546997, "runtime_cat": 24.294, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.764", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984141535772", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewrather trying segment start making model simply try identify boat show image model see roughly performs compititon guessing whole image rle boat show smart startegy might provide interesting result beyondthe model could also useful quick way low resolution image screen lot image see likely boat run much expensive fullresolution unet sample", "tags_descriptive": ["Transfer Learning"]}
