{"title": "Private Leaderboard - [0.750]", "description": "Manual Model Manipulation TrickIn this kernel, we load a public Kaggle model's submission file, view it's malware infection rate over time, and modify it manually to match what train.csv's malware rate looks like over time. The original submission file scores Public LB 0.689 and Private LB 0.635. After correction, the updated file scores Public LB 0.693 and Private LB 0.750. I used this trick during the competition to increase Public LB score. But it wasn't until after the competition's end that I learned how to increase Private LB score. In the private test dataset, all computers on and after November 20, 2018 have HasDetections=0 approximately.
