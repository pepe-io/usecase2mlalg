{"title": "EDA, Feature Engineering and model interpretation", "description": "General informationIn this kernel I'm working with data from TMDB Box Office Prediction Challenge. Film industry is booming, the revunues are growing, so we have a lot of data about films. Can we build models, which will be able to accurately predict film revenues? Could this models be used to make some changes in movies to increase their revenues even further? I'll try answer this questions in my kernel!
