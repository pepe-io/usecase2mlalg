{"title": "Ensemble Learning with Feature Engineering", "description": "Ensemble Learning with ExtraTreesIn this Tutorial I am going to explain in details how to classify the cover_type dataset using Ensemble learning. In many cases machine learning algorithms don't perform well without feature engineering which is the process of filling NaNs and missing values , creating new features and etc... . I will be performing some exploratory data analysis to perform feature engineering before implementing the suitable model.
