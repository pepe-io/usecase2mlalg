{"title": "Simple CNN using Keras", "description": "The goal of this kernel is to create a simple Convolution Neural Network that will allow to differentiate images that contains cacti from images that do not. While better results closer to 100% accuracy could be designed using layers from pre-trained models such as VGG16, we want to stick with a fairly simple CNN architecture and see how far we can go, and whether pre-trained layers are even needed.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/frlemarchand/simple-cnn-using-keras", "tags": ["DL", "CNN"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-05-01 00:28:23", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:10:46", "words": 69, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.12063124030828476, "description_category_runtime": 6.726, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9848948121070862, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.233, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.12063124030828476, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9848948121070862, "runtime_cat": 16.962, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.706", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999995720611736", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "goal kernel create simple convolution neural network allow differentiate image contains cactus image better result closer 100 accuracy could designed using layer pretrained model vgg16 want stick fairly simple cnn architecture see far go whether pretrained layer even needed", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
