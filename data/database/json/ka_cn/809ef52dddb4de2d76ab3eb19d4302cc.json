{"title": "Achieving SOTA Results with Tabnet", "description": "About this NotebookIf anyone of you have read my previous kernels , you might know how much I love the EDA part , but it struck me that writing on one particular thing would not help me grow , so I have decided to explore untreaded territories to explore new things. For this competition people are mostly using Rapids and the tabular data . I have hardly seen any kernels using only images and both images and tabular data . Few days ago I saw Abhishek's post on LinkedIn about Tabnet and I was really curious about it , I wanted to apply the idea here on Trends data but it had already been done and didn't give good results so I dropped it. After watching Sebastian on Abhishek talks , I realized that Tabnet's potential isn't being fully utilized . This notebook presents a fully structured working pipeline for training n-folds Tabnet Regressor for this competition . This Notebook achieves 0.1620 without a lot of efforts and this notbook could beat Rapids SVM's and achieve the benchmark 0.1595 with some tweaks . I also explain the pros and cons of using Tabnets (although I don't find a lot cons  ) Here is the link to Tabnet Paper If you like my efforts please leava an upvote .As I am not planning on doing this competition for now , if you all like my efforts I plan to release more public kernels on Tabnet with higher scores", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077/achieving-sota-results-with-tabnet", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-01 15:56:53", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:52:38", "words": 248, "sentences": 8, "sum_nltk": "For this competition people are mostly using Rapids and the tabular data .\nI have hardly seen any kernels using only images and both images and tabular data .\nFew days ago I saw Abhishek's post on LinkedIn about Tabnet and I was really curious about it , I wanted to apply the idea here on Trends data but it had already been done and didn't give good results so I dropped it.\nAfter watching Sebastian on Abhishek talks , I realized that Tabnet's potential isn't being fully utilized .\nThis notebook presents a fully structured working pipeline for training n-folds Tabnet Regressor for this competition .\nThis Notebook achieves 0.1620 without a lot of efforts and this notbook could beat Rapids SVM's and achieve the benchmark 0.1595 with some tweaks .\nI also explain the pros and cons of using Tabnets (although I don't find a lot cons  ) Here is the link to Tabnet Paper If you like my efforts please leava an upvote .As I am not planning on doing this competition for now , if you all like my efforts I plan to release more public kernels on Tabnet with higher scores", "sum_nltk_words": 191, "sum_nltk_runtime": 0.002, "sum_t5": "notebook n-folds tabnet regressor could beat Rapids SVM's and achieve the benchmark 0.1595 with some tweaks. if you like my efforts please leava an upvote. if you like my efforts please leava an upvote. if you like my efforts please leava an upvote. if you like my efforts please leava an upvote. if you like my efforts please leava an upvote.", "sum_t5_words": 61, "sum_t5_runtime": 5.239, "runtime": 0.005, "nltk_category": "Manufacturing", "nltk_category_score": 0.11849487572908401, "nltk_category_runtime": 16.41, "nltk_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "nltk_subcategory_score": 0.7351494431495667, "nltk_subcategory_runtime": 26.552, "category": "Manufacturing", "category_score": 0.11849487572908401, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7351494431495667, "runtime_cat": 42.962, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.708", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974907556651", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebookif anyone read previous kernel might know much love eda part struck writing one particular thing would help grow decided explore untreaded territory explore new thing competition people mostly using rapid tabular data hardly seen kernel using image image tabular data day ago saw abhisheks post linkedin tabnet really curious wanted apply idea trend data already done didnt give good result dropped watching sebastian abhishek talk realized tabnets potential isnt fully utilized notebook present fully structured working pipeline training nfolds tabnet regressor competition notebook achieves 01620 without lot effort notbook could beat rapid svms achieve benchmark 01595 tweak also explain pro con using tabnets although dont find lot con link tabnet paper like effort please leava upvote planning competition like effort plan release public kernel tabnet higher score", "tags_descriptive": []}
