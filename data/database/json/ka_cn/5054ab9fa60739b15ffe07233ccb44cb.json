{"title": "Alaska2 Analyzing Model Predictions ", "description": "In my previous kernel, I trained a multiclass CNN based classifier. I was curious to understand what the CNN is learning, since detecting if hidden message is present or not seems to be impossible visually. So, in this kernel, I try to do a Grad-Cam visualization to understand which parts the CNN is focussing on. Inspired by Remi's earlier work, I also plot the RGB difference and DCT difference for easier comparison.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/meaninglesslives/alaska2-analyzing-model-predictions", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch", "albumentations"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-06-12 01:52:46", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:29:24", "words": 72, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.3154672682285309, "description_category_runtime": 7.244, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9424994587898254, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.153, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.3154672682285309, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9424994587898254, "runtime_cat": 19.398, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.661", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999971289128551", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "previous kernel trained multiclass cnn based classifier curious understand cnn learning since detecting hidden message present seems impossible visually kernel try gradcam visualization understand part cnn focussing inspired remis earlier work also plot rgb difference dct difference easier comparison", "tags_descriptive": []}
