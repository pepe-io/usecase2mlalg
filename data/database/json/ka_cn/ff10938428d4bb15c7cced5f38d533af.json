Thank you all, my friends, for reading my kernels about this competition:  WBF approach for ensemble [Training] EfficientDet [Inference] EfficientDet [OOF-Evaluation][Mixup] EfficientDet [Bayesian optimization WBF] EfficientDet  All of them have got golden zone! It is crazy :) thank you! It means that kernels are useful for you, my friends!
