As an initial path to start optimization from I'll use the output from my another kernel.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kostyaatarik/not-a-5-and-5-halves-opt", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-01-13 19:14:35", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:50:10", "words": 75, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.12640486657619476, "description_category_runtime": 6.815, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.3729085624217987, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.351, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.12640486657619476, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.3729085624217987, "runtime_cat": 17.166, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.681", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999979995738224", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel based previous kernel share idea permutating chunk path expands five point handle permutation much faster moving code find best permutation chunk numba great tool squeeze everything python initial path start optimization ill use output another kernel", "tags_descriptive": []}
