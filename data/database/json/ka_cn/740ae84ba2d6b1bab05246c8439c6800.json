{"title": "EDA + Model", "description": "OverviewThe purpose of this kernel is to take a look at the data, come up with some insights, and attempt to create a predictive model or two. This notebook is still very raw - the first few EDA sections have been decently explored/formatted, but the latter predictive sections are completely uncommented. I hope to work on those as my, very limited, time permits. PackagesFirst, let's load a few useful Python packages. This section will keep growing in subsequent versions of this EDA.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/eda-model", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-07-24 02:45:05", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:59:32", "words": 82, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.22683799266815186, "description_category_runtime": 8.266, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2555263340473175, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.353, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.22683799266815186, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.2555263340473175, "runtime_cat": 20.619, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.677", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999962815594288", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewthe purpose kernel take look data come insight attempt create predictive model two notebook still raw first eda section decently exploredformatted latter predictive section completely uncommented hope work limited time permit packagesfirst let load useful python package section keep growing subsequent version eda", "tags_descriptive": []}
