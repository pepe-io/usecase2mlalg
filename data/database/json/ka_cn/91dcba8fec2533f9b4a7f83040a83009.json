Best FID MiFID Penalization     How Supervised GANs work and how to improve it. Discriminator memory test. Tricks to avoid MiFID Penalization.    From a noob point of view ;) This kernel is obviously based on: Dog Memorizer GAN , is pure knowledge so please upvote it, and the post Memorization GAN Explained As you can check here: Rules clarification on Generative Models this method is allowed.  If you are interested in these kind of explanations, I can publish a kernel about my Private LB simulation (Private Dataset and Private NN). So, if this helps you, don't forget to upvote   :)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jesucristo/memorizer-cgan-for-dummies", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-07-12 07:09:57", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:11:09", "words": 127, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.07161008566617966, "description_category_runtime": 12.443, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.31952258944511414, "description_subcategory_runtime": 19.537, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.07161008566617966, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.31952258944511414, "runtime_cat": 31.979, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.724", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999979185564271", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "memorizer cgan dummy youre going see gans cgans destroy fid metric best fid mifid penalization supervised gans work improve discriminator memory test trick avoid mifid penalization noob point view kernel obviously based dog memorizer gan pure knowledge please upvote post memorization gan explained check rule clarification generative model method allowed interested kind explanation publish kernel private lb simulation private dataset private nn help dont forget upvote", "tags_descriptive": []}
