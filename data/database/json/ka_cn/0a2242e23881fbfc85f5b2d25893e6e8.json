{"title": "A new baseline for DSB 2019 - Catboost model", "description": "I had posted my very naive baseline at https://www.kaggle.com/mhviraf/a-baseline-for-dsb-2019. In that kernel I only used the mode label for each Assessment and I thought it should be very easy to beat. This kernel shows how you can beat that baseline by actually applying a model. In this kernel via get_data() function, I go over each installation_id and try to extract some features based on his/her behavior prior to the assessment. I will then train a Catboost classifier on it and make predictions on the test set. Note that the features I made in this kernel are so very basic and you can easily add many more to it. Good luck and happy kaggling.
