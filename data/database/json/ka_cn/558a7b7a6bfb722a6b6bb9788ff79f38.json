{"title": "Baselines-To-Start-With(LB=0.56+)", "description": "Hi, Kagglers! Hereafter I will try to publish some basic approaches to climb up the Leaderboard Competition goal In this competition, Daimler is challenging Kagglers to tackle the curse of dimensionality and reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Competitors will work with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms will contribute to speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler\u2019s standards. The Notebook adopts skeleton from (maybe?) this script: https://www.kaggle.com/ermolushka/starter-xgboost Stay tuned, this notebook will be updated on a regular basisP.s.
