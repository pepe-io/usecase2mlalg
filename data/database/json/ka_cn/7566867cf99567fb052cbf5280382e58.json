{"title": "TReNDS - EDA + Visualization + Simple Baseline ", "description": "About this NotebookIn this notebook, i will try to cover following topics in as much detail as possible:  Domain Knowledge: In general, domain knowledge is important when posing the question you want answered from data, as well as understanding the limitations of the data. If you don't understand these things (e.g., if you're working with a client on a new problem), then an essential skill is being able to ask the right questions to tease these things out. Basic statistics on the dataset Extensive EDA Visualization of spatial maps Sample Submission  This kernel will be a work in Progress,and I will keep on updating it as the competition progresses Please upvote this kernel if you like it . It motivates me to produce more quality content :)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsingh9990/trends-eda-visualization-simple-baseline", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["spacy"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-06 12:51:17", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:52:38", "words": 129, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.20944532752037048, "description_category_runtime": 11.179, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5350064635276794, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.184, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.20944532752037048, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.5350064635276794, "runtime_cat": 28.364, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.761", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997163143776", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebookin notebook try cover following topic much detail possible domain knowledge general domain knowledge important posing question want answered data well understanding limitation data dont understand thing eg youre working client new problem essential skill able ask right question tease thing basic statistic dataset extensive eda visualization spatial map sample submission kernel work progressand keep updating competition progress please upvote kernel like motivates produce quality content", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
