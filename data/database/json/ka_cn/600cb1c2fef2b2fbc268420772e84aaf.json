Also I'll compare various models. I use the features from my dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/lanl-features This dataset was created using this kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/even-more-features/ UPD: Thanks to the new kaggle update we can write code in kernels and import it. This is much more convenient and useful. I'm moving all the functions I can into this script: https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/artgor-utils So if you see somewhere code like artgot_utils.function_name(parameters) - it is from this script", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/feature-selection-model-interpretation-and-more", "tags": ["Regression", "Model Explainability"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-05-12 18:54:06", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:01:16", "words": 83, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.8734514713287354, "description_category_runtime": 11.485, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9911639094352722, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.943, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.8734514713287354, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9911639094352722, "runtime_cat": 29.43, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.776", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972346395849", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general informationin kernel ill try various technics model interpretability feature selection also ill compare various model use feature dataset httpswwwkagglecomartgorlanlfeatures dataset created using kernel httpswwwkagglecomartgorevenmorefeatures upd thanks new kaggle update write code kernel import much convenient useful im moving function script httpswwwkagglecomartgorartgorutils see somewhere code like artgot_utilsfunction_nameparameters script", "tags_descriptive": ["Regression", "Model Explainability"]}
