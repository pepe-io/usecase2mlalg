{"title": "Where do the robots drive?", "description": "General informationIn this competition we have data about small mobile robot driving over different floor surfaces. We need to predict the floor type based on robot's sensor data. In this kernel I'll do EDA on the data, try FE and build a variety of models.  work in progress", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/where-do-the-robots-drive", "tags": ["Classification", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["xgboost", "lightgbm", "sklearn", "pattern", "catboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-04-10 21:28:04", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:33:04", "words": 49, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.14721503853797913, "description_category_runtime": 5.051, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9940935969352722, "description_subcategory_runtime": 7.727, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.14721503853797913, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9940935969352722, "runtime_cat": 12.78, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.747", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999979336457873", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general informationin competition data small mobile robot driving different floor surface need predict floor type based robot sensor data kernel ill eda data try fe build variety model work progress", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering"]}
