{"title": "Zillow Revamped with Memory Reduction!", "description": "Here is what was done on the first Zillow kernel:  Look into the data (ofcourse!!) Visualize the various independent variables visually (links for the same are provided) Check for columns showing non-variance Split columns based on their data types. Carefully perform further analysis on missing values in those columns with respect to the values they can possibly hold; rather than assinging them to '0' blindly!  What we did later:  Created new meaningful features (from 60 to 82 columns) Visualizing the features.(to be updated)  What we did NOW:  Looked into memory consumption of the dataframe and REDUCED it !!  As always let's take a look into the data.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jeru666/zillow-revamped-with-memory-reduction", "tags": ["Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-11-19 07:28:22", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:50:10", "words": 113, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.4270765781402588, "description_category_runtime": 10.783, "description_subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6015430688858032, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.369, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.4270765781402588, "subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "subcategory_score": 0.6015430688858032, "runtime_cat": 27.153, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.716", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999966980188002", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "done first zillow kernel look data ofcourse visualize various independent variable visually link provided check column showing nonvariance split column based data type carefully perform analysis missing value column respect value possibly hold rather assinging 0 blindly later created new meaningful feature 60 82 column visualizing featuresto updated looked memory consumption dataframe reduced always let take look data", "tags_descriptive": ["Feature Engineering"]}
