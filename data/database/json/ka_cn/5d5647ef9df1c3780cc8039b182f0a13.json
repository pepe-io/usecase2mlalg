A Beginner's Guide to ARIMA models", "description": "Recruit Holdings : Forecasting VisitorsThis is an exploration of ARIMA  modeling techniques using R's built-in time series packages for the Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting. The goal of this challenge is to forecast future visitor demand at various restaurants. The dataset fits on a simple computer and is ideal to play around with.  While the competition provides a number of structured datasets, for this exploration, we will only be using the following two datasets: 1. air_visit_data.csv : historical data for the air restaurants, this is the main dataset 2. air_store_info.csv : details about the restaurants such as location and genre  Time Series PrimerA time series is a structured dataset that can be annual, monthly, or in this case daily. To begin to understand the models, lets outline some key concepts about time-series.  Time series has to be stationary There are 3 conditions that must be fulfilled, otherwise a time series cannot be modeled  1. Constant Mean: AKA no overall trend   2. Constant Variance: the magnitude of waviness should remain constant   3. Frequency: the waves should be evenly spaced   Another consideration: Seasonailty <img src ='https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2012/09/High_Seasonality_Pic1.png' /> Seasonality can be on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.  Example:the sales of products around Christmas every year Example: the number of public transit riders during different days of the week.  Simple example: Airplane passengers Note above, the above time series has both a linear upward trend and a seasonal cycle. Luckily the upward trend and seasonality can be addressed with time series techniques  Forecasting in R: ARIMA Models The main technique being explored is ARIMA which stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average. Wikipedia defines ARIMA as: \"stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models. Univariate (single vector) ARIMA is a forecasting technique that projects the future values of a series based entirely on its own inertia. Its main application is in the area of short term forecasting requiring at least 40 historical data points.\" The auto regressive part of the model determines the dependence on previous time points. The moving average part of the model determines the dependence on errors at different points", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/timolee/feeling-hungry-a-beginner-s-guide-to-arima-models", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-02 11:00:40", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:32:50", "words": 363, "sentences": 18, "sum_nltk": "Recruit Holdings : Forecasting VisitorsThis is an exploration of ARIMA  modeling techniques using R's built-in time series packages for the Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting.\nair_visit_data.csv : historical data for the air restaurants, this is the main dataset 2.\nair_store_info.csv : details about the restaurants such as location and genre  Time Series PrimerA time series is a structured dataset that can be annual, monthly, or in this case daily.\nSimple example: Airplane passengers Note above, the above time series has both a linear upward trend and a seasonal cycle.\nLuckily the upward trend and seasonality can be addressed with time series techniques  Forecasting in R: ARIMA Models The main technique being explored is ARIMA which stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average.\nWikipedia defines ARIMA as: \"stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models.\nUnivariate (single vector) ARIMA is a forecasting technique that projects the future values of a series based entirely on its own inertia.\nIts main application is in the area of short term forecasting requiring at least 40 historical data points.\" The auto regressive part of the model determines the dependence on previous time points.\nThe moving average part of the model determines the dependence on errors at different points", "sum_nltk_words": 196, "sum_nltk_runtime": 0.004, "sum_t5": "Recruit Holdings is exploring ARIMA modeling techniques using its built-in time series packages. the dataset fits on a simple computer and is ideal to play around with. the main technique is ARIMA which stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average models. the technique is based entirely on its own inertia. the competition provides a number of structured datasets, but we will only be using the following two datasets. a time series is a structured dataset that can be annual, monthly", "sum_t5_words": 80, "sum_t5_runtime": 6.95, "runtime": 0.005, "nltk_category": "Utilities", "nltk_category_score": 0.04272592440247536, "nltk_category_runtime": 18.685, "nltk_subcategory": "Restaurant", "nltk_subcategory_score": 0.7716852426528931, "nltk_subcategory_runtime": 30.042, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.04272592440247536, "subcategory": "Restaurant", "subcategory_score": 0.7716852426528931, "runtime_cat": 48.727, "programming_language": "R notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.745", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999964827585223", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "recruit holding forecasting visitorsthis exploration arima modeling technique using r builtin time series package recruit restaurant visitor forecasting goal challenge forecast future visitor demand various restaurant dataset fit simple computer ideal play around competition provides number structured datasets exploration using following two datasets 1 air_visit_datacsv historical data air restaurant main dataset 2 air_store_infocsv detail restaurant location genre time series primera time series structured dataset annual monthly case daily begin understand model let outline key concept timeseries time series stationary 3 condition must fulfilled otherwise time series cannot modeled 1 constant mean aka overall trend 2 constant variance magnitude waviness remain constant 3 frequency wave evenly spaced another consideration seasonailty img src httpssearchenginelandcomfigzwpcontentseloads201209high_seasonality_pic1png seasonality weekly monthly quarterly annual basis examplethe sale product around christmas every year example number public transit rider different day week simple example airplane passenger note time series linear upward trend seasonal cycle luckily upward trend seasonality addressed time series technique forecasting r arima model main technique explored arima stand auto regressive integrated moving average wikipedia defines arima stand autoregressive integrated moving average model univariate single vector arima forecasting technique project future value series based entirely inertia main application area short term forecasting requiring least 40 historical data point auto regressive part model determines dependence previous time point moving average part model determines dependence error different point", "tags_descriptive": []}
