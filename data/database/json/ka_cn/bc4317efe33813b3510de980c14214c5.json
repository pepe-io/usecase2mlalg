PyTorch is a promising port of Facebook's Torch to Python. It's only 3 months old but has an already promising feature set. Unfortunately it's very very raw, and I had a lot of troubles to get started with very basic things:  data loading building a basic CNN training  Hopefully this will help you getting started using PyTorch on this dataset.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mratsim/starting-kit-for-pytorch-deep-learning", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "Pillow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-10-04 18:13:29", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 15:31:34", "words": 79, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "description_category_score": 0.1972235143184662, "description_category_runtime": 7.581, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9413742423057556, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.825, "category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "category_score": 0.1972235143184662, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9413742423057556, "runtime_cat": 19.406, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.786", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999971245467528", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "starting kit pytorch deep learningwelcome tutorial get started pytorch competition pytorch promising port facebooks torch python 3 month old already promising feature set unfortunately raw lot trouble get started basic thing data loading building basic cnn training hopefully help getting started using pytorch dataset", "tags_descriptive": []}
