{"title": "Exploring Signal Processing with Scipy", "description": "Signal processing with ScipyBelow, we will explore different methods for processing and cleaning signal with Scipy. I haven't worked extensively with signal processing, so if there is any expert out there who would have insight or suggestion in improving this work, please let me know! About ScipySciPy (pronounced \u201cSigh Pie\u201d) is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.   Scipy is an extremely useful library for scientific and numerical computing in Python. It contains very useful submodules for Optimization, Fast Fourier Transform, Linear Algebra, Matrix Encoding, and Image Processing. In fact, Scikit-learn uses it extensively for maniputating large sparse matrix, and for algorithms such as Ordinary Least Square! We will focus on the signal processing submodule for this exploration notebook. This is a work in progress, so please tune in for more updates!
