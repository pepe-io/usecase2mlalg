{"title": "K-MNIST: Ensemble of 4 Models LB 0.985+ StarterKit", "description": "Introduction  In this kernel we will be exploring different model architectures, their performance (against one another) and create an ensembled submission of all of our models and submit it to the Leaderboard. I've picked 4 of my best performing models so far for this kernel, everything coded up using the fast.ai library and PyTorch. And... Please don't forget to smash that UPVOTE button.  So lets jump right into it...  What are we doing in this kernel? 1. Getting Started  2. Loading Data + EDA  3. Data Processing  4. Defining our Models  5. Training and Inference  6. Comparing Model Performances  7. Creating Average Ensembled Submission", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/abhinand05/k-mnist-ensemble-of-4-models-lb-0-985-starterkit", "tags": ["DL", "Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pytorch", "caffe"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-11-04 13:23:59", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:26:21", "words": 113, "sentences": 13, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.17218059301376343, "description_category_runtime": 10.655, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7384734749794006, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.641, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.17218059301376343, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7384734749794006, "runtime_cat": 27.296, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.634", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968639493088", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introduction kernel exploring different model architecture performance one another create ensembled submission model submit leaderboard ive picked 4 best performing model far kernel everything coded using fastai library pytorch please dont forget smash upvote button let jump right kernel 1 getting started 2 loading data eda 3 data processing 4 defining model 5 training inference 6 comparing model performance 7 creating average ensembled submission", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
