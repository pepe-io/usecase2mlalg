{"title": "WBF approach for ensemble", "description": "How to make stable ensemble in object detectionHi everyone! My name is Alex Shonenkov, I am DL/NLP/CV/TS research engineer. Especially I am in Love with NLP & DL. Today I would like to share with you, my friends, super easy technique for bbox postprocessing and making ensemble in object detection tasks. I spied this idea from really good russian competitions grandmaster Roman Solovyev ZFTurbo in this repository that I used in this kernel as dataset. original paper: Weighted Boxes Fusion: ensembling boxes for object detection models", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/wbf-approach-for-ensemble", "tags": ["DL"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch", "albumentations"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-13 23:55:39", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:14:55", "words": 86, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.31779032945632935, "description_category_runtime": 9.007, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9206597208976746, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.916, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.31779032945632935, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9206597208976746, "runtime_cat": 22.923, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.758", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999959509583222", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "make stable ensemble object detectionhi everyone name alex shonenkov dlnlpcvts research engineer especially love nlp dl today would like share friend super easy technique bbox postprocessing making ensemble object detection task spied idea really good russian competition grandmaster roman solovyev zfturbo repository used kernel dataset original paper weighted box fusion ensembling box object detection model", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)"]}
