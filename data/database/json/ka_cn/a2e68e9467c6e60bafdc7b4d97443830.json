{"title": "Rating teams using Microsoft's TrueSkill algorithm", "description": "Microsoft has created an algorithm called TrueSkill for the purpose of ranking players using its video game platform.  It is basically a probabalistic algorithm based on the Elo algorithm used to rank chess players.  It can be used to rank players in any activity where there is some concept of win/lose/draw.  The algorithm itself is somewhat hard to understand but fortunately someone has created a Python package which makes it easy to use without understanding the theory behind it.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/gkoundry/rating-teams-using-microsoft-s-trueskill-algorithm", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-21 15:06:36", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:59:30", "words": 82, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.01183202862739563, "description_category_runtime": 7.612, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.18275971710681915, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.653, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.01183202862739563, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.18275971710681915, "runtime_cat": 19.266, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.642", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999998548031157", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "microsoft created algorithm called trueskill purpose ranking player using video game platform basically probabalistic algorithm based elo algorithm used rank chess player used rank player activity concept winlosedraw algorithm somewhat hard understand fortunately someone created python package make easy use without understanding theory behind", "tags_descriptive": []}
