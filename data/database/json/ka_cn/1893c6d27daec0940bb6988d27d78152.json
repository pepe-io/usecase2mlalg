{"title": "The Viterbi Algorithm - A Complete Solution", "description": "Introduction The problem we are trying to solve in this competition is known as a Hidden Markov Model. There exists an algorithm which finds the most probable solution for such problems without any \"real machine learning\": the Viterbi algorithm. In this notebook, I explain this algorithm and apply it to the problem at hand. Since the organizers have mentioned the Viterbi algorithm several times, I think it's instructive to demonstrate it here, even though it also results in a LB score of only ~0.935, providing further confirmation for the fact that there simpy isn't any additional information available in the data.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/friedchips/the-viterbi-algorithm-a-complete-solution", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-20 15:08:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:17:30", "words": 101, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.29789042472839355, "description_category_runtime": 9.362, "description_subcategory": "Judicial Applied", "description_subcategory_score": 0.19622398912906647, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.124, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.29789042472839355, "subcategory": "Judicial Applied", "subcategory_score": 0.19622398912906647, "runtime_cat": 23.486, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.704", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999947822960153", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introduction problem trying solve competition known hidden markov model exists algorithm find probable solution problem without real machine learning viterbi algorithm notebook explain algorithm apply problem hand since organizer mentioned viterbi algorithm several time think instructive demonstrate even though also result lb score 0935 providing confirmation fact simpy isnt additional information available data", "tags_descriptive": []}
