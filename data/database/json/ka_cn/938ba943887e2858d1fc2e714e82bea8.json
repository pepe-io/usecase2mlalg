Original paper states - \" Our model struggles with small objects that appear in groups, such as flocks of birds.\", but it seems that YOLO can be useful for swarm type things as well.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/vijaybj/yolo-for-detection-of-bounding-boxes-tensorflow", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-05-18 07:40:34", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:38:54", "words": 71, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.08832880109548569, "description_category_runtime": 7.318, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.611748218536377, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.114, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.08832880109548569, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.611748218536377, "runtime_cat": 18.433, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.775", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.99999742139958", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introthis piece work inspired youtube video lecture martin gorner google developer put forth idea combining yolo grid squeezenet instead darknet original stack yolo original paper state model struggle small object appear group flock bird seems yolo useful swarm type thing well", "tags_descriptive": []}
