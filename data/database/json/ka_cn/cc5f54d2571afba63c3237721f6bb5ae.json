My name is Alex Shonenkov, I am researcher, in Love with NLP and DL. Recently I have published my ideas about this competition:  [TPU-Inference] Super Fast XLMRoberta NLP Albumentations Hack with Parallel Corpus Class Balance with PyTorch/XLA open-subtitles-toxic-pseudo-labeling  if you didn't see this kernels and datasets, I recommend to read all of them because it may help you for better understand this kernel and achieve success in competition :)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/tpu-training-super-fast-xlmroberta", "tags": ["DL", "NLP"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["albumentations", "nltk", "sklearn", "spacy", "pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-04 21:54:30", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:15:35", "words": 81, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.5913428664207458, "description_category_runtime": 9.629, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6547632813453674, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.948, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.5913428664207458, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6547632813453674, "runtime_cat": 24.577, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.748", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999971517211548", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "training pipeline shonenkov using multi tpu pytorchxlahi everyone name alex shonenkov researcher love nlp dl recently published idea competition tpuinference super fast xlmroberta nlp albumentations hack parallel corpus class balance pytorchxla opensubtitlestoxicpseudolabeling didnt see kernel datasets recommend read may help better understand kernel achieve success competition", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Natural Language Processing (NLP)"]}
