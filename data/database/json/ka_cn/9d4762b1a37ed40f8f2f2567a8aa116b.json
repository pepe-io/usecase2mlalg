IntroductionMarch Madness is a period of excitement for everyone: from the die-hard fan to the serial gambler, this NCAA tournament has something for all. One of the major draws of the competition is its intangible and intoxicating element of unpredictability: with the closely packed games and high end teams, there\u2019s always a chance for an upset, for an unexpected streak, or for a \u201cCinderella story.\u201d We set out here to try to uncover whether or not these seemingly unpredictable moments could be anticipated? What truly contributes to the \u201cmadness\u201d of a game and to this season of collegiate basketball? Our first challenge in this endeavor was attempting to define \u201cmadness.\u201d Are we referring to the intensity of the game? the moves of each player on the court? Or are we referring to the crowd\u2019s reaction to the outcome of a match? to the fan\u2019s entertainment back home? Rather than limit our exploration, we decided to consider both possibilities. To do this effectively, we separated our work into two distinct categories: 1) that of empirical and \u201cobjective\u201d madness that arises from the teams\u2019 past game statistics and match events, and 2) that of emotional and \u201csubjective\u201d madness that comes from the enthusiasm of the fans while watching a game. This second type of madness is evaluated in a separate notebook which follows this one. Depending on who you ask, madness can have many meanings, but here we focus on it as the entertainment and pleasure that unites everyone around a great game of basketball. 2. NCAA March Madness Data AnalysisFor exploring the objective madness in this competition, the main data source at our disposal is the NCAA data provided through Kaggle. This data source is full of detailed and relevant information for the 2015 to 2019 seasons, from team and player names down to precisely recorded details on events that occur during each match! 2.1. Seeding and EntertainmentThe main question we explored is: can entertainment be linked to a team\u2019s seed? In the extreme case of this is whether, by default, watching a seed 1 team compete will inherently be more enjoyable than watching a seed 16 team compete? We did this by first looking at specific events that occur during matches and working to see whether certain events were correlated with certain seeds. To perform this analysis, we start by loading useful packages as well as the relevant data. We opted to use some pre-processing performed by JasonVizkovic in his Notebook: Moreyball in the College Game...A Full NCAA EDA. It was particularly useful for helping us to isolate definite scoring attempts, understand whether they were assisted or not, and more.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/emimis/madness-at-home-and-on-the-court-part-1", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["xgboost", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-01 01:35:02", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:49:58", "words": 517, "sentences": 13, "sum_nltk": "Madness at Home and on the Court - Part 1Authors: Emilien Etchevers, Kieran Janin, Michael Karpe, Remi Le Thai, Haley Wohlever ContentsIn this notebook  Introduction  NCAA March Madness Data Analysis Seeding and Entertainment Madness through Unpredictability Entertainment due to Closeness of Games    In the second notebook:  Tweets on NCAA Data Analysis Temporal Evolution of Engagement Team Mentions Count in Tweets Sentiment Analysis for Tweets on NCAA   Conclusion  1.\nDepending on who you ask, madness can have many meanings, but here we focus on it as the entertainment and pleasure that unites everyone around a great game of basketball.\n2.
