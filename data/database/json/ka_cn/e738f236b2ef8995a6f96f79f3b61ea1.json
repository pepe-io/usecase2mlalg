{"title": "1. MPNN ", "description": "Message Passing Neural NetworkSo, as many of you might have surmised by now the dataset for this challenge is essentially the QM9 dataset with some new values calculated for it. The first thing I though of when seeing this challenge was the Gilmer paper, as it uses the QM9 dataset. (see this talk) The major difference in this challenge is that we are asked to calulate bond properties (thus edges in a graph) as opposed to bulk properties in the paper. Here the model is laid out in a modular way so the parts can easily be replaced", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/fnands/1-mpnn", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-08-07 10:16:25", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:53:35", "words": 98, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Manufacturing", "description_category_score": 0.10467889904975891, "description_category_runtime": 8.741, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9439230561256409, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.496, "category": "Manufacturing", "category_score": 0.10467889904975891, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9439230561256409, "runtime_cat": 22.237, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.755", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974727415302", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "message passing neural networkso many might surmised dataset challenge essentially qm9 dataset new value calculated first thing though seeing challenge gilmer paper us qm9 dataset see talk major difference challenge asked calulate bond property thus edge graph opposed bulk property paper model laid modular way part easily replaced", "tags_descriptive": []}
