We will focus in this notebook on the features found in the train.csv file. Intially we will perform descriptive univariate analysis. Next we will study how the response variables change given a set of featuers and/or their subsets.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/leo1988/exploratory-data-analysis-using-plotly", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-27 23:19:00", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:37:12", "words": 65, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.23826484382152557, "description_category_runtime": 6.862, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4291689395904541, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.364, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.23826484382152557, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.4291689395904541, "runtime_cat": 17.226, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.678", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999948266013114", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "exploratory data analysisgernerally within exploratory data analysis treyt see data tell u actual task modelling hypothesis testing focus notebook feature found traincsv file intially perform descriptive univariate analysis next study response variable change given set featuers andor subset", "tags_descriptive": []}
