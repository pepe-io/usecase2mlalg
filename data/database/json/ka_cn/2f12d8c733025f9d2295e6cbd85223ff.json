Did you ever go through your vacation photos and ask yourself: What is the name of this temple I visited in China? Who created this monument I saw in France? Landmark recognition can help! This technology can predict landmark labels directly from image pixels, to help people better understand and organize their photo collections. This competition challenges Kagglers to build models that recognize the correct landmark (if any) in a dataset of challenging test images.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sandy1112/landmarkreco-2020-class-imbalance-deep-dive-eda", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-25 07:41:44", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:43:16", "words": 96, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Media & Publishing", "description_category_score": 0.08951812237501144, "description_category_runtime": 8.995, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.41943925619125366, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.791, "category": "Media & Publishing", "category_score": 0.08951812237501144, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.41943925619125366, "runtime_cat": 22.786, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.674", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999986046700685", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "google landmark recognition 2020 label famous notsofamous landmark image third landmark recognition competition series ever go vacation photo ask name temple visited china created monument saw france landmark recognition help technology predict landmark label directly image pixel help people better understand organize photo collection competition challenge kagglers build model recognize correct landmark dataset challenging test image", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
