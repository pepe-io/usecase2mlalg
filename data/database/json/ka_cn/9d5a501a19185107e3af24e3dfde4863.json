{"title": "IEEE - Internal Blend", "description": "SummaryI'll try to make a small summary for this blend baseline: Step: 0. EDA (missing kernel here, I'll post later) Step: 1. Minify Data https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-data-minification  Step: 2. Make ground baseline with no fe: https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-ground-baseline and  https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-ground-baseline-deeper-learning  Step: 3. Make a small FE and see I you can understand data you have https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-ground-baseline-make-amount-useful-again and  https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-gb-2-make-amount-useful-again  Step: 4. Find good CV strategy https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-cv-options and same with gap to compare results (gap in values is what we have in test set) https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-cv-options-with-gap  Step: 4(1). Groupkfold (by timeblocks) application https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-lgbm-with-groupkfold-cv  Step: 5. Try different set of features https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-experimental  Step: 6. Make deeper FE (brute force option) https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-fe-with-some-eda  Step: 7. Features selection (missing kernel here, I'll post later) Step: 8. Hyperopt (missing kernel here, I'll post later) Step: 9. Try other models (XGBoost, CatBoost, NN - missing kernel here, I'll post later) CatBoost (with categorical transformations)  https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-catboost-baseline-with-groupkfold-cv  Step: 10. Try blending and stacking (missing kernel here, I'll post later)  (Utils) Some tricks that where used in fe kernel https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-small-tricks  Part of EDA (Just few things) https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-check-noise and https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-simple-eda   https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/discussion/104142", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-internal-blend", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["catboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-09-01 01:47:11", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 21:40:28", "words": 189, "sentences": 13, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.8611481189727783, "description_category_runtime": 44.584, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7413538694381714, "description_subcategory_runtime": 73.743, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.8611481189727783, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7413538694381714, "runtime_cat": 118.327, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.764", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999956944303425", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "summaryill try make small summary blend baseline step 0 eda missing kernel ill post later step 1 minify data httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeedataminification step 2 make ground baseline fe httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeegroundbaseline httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeegroundbaselinedeeperlearning step 3 make small fe see understand data httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeegroundbaselinemakeamountusefulagain httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeegb2makeamountusefulagain step 4 find good cv strategy httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeecvoptions gap compare result gap value test set httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeecvoptionswithgap step 41 groupkfold timeblocks application httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeelgbmwithgroupkfoldcv step 5 try different set feature httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeeexperimental step 6 make deeper fe brute force option httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeefewithsomeeda step 7 feature selection missing kernel ill post later step 8 hyperopt missing kernel ill post later step 9 try model xgboost catboost nn missing kernel ill post later catboost categorical transformation httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeecatboostbaselinewithgroupkfoldcv step 10 try blending stacking missing kernel ill post later utils trick used fe kernel httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeesmalltricks part eda thing httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeechecknoise httpswwwkagglecomkyakovlevieeesimpleeda httpswwwkagglecomcieeefrauddetectiondiscussion104142", "tags_descriptive": []}
