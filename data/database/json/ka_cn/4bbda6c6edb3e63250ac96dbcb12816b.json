{"title": " 2019 Data Science Bowl - An Introduction", "description": "2019 Data Science BowlA Simple Introductiontl;dr In this challenge, you\u2019ll use anonymous gameplay data, including knowledge of videos watched and games played, from the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, a game-based learning tool developed as a part of the CPB-PBS Ready To Learn Initiative with funding from the U.S. Department of Education. Competitors will be challenged to predict scores on in-game assessments and create an algorithm that will lead to better-designed games and improved learning outcomes.   Note that this is a synchronous rerun code competition and the private test set has approximately 8MM rows. You should be mindful of memory in your notebooks to avoid submission errors.
