{"title": "A different validation technique", "description": "I think its save to say that everyone taking part in this competition has had problems with validation. Local CV score does not at all represent the leaderboard score. Some people have even described a negative correlation. And how are we supposed to solve this problem without any idea if our model is good without submitting to the leaderboard first (and keep in mind that the public LB is evaluated only on 50% on the data too). We have to find a better way of local validation. In this kernel I try a different technique. I wouldn't dare to call it better because I have not thoroughly evaluated it but it is certainly interesting.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/bminixhofer/a-different-validation-technique", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-07-11 19:48:03", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:15:37", "words": 114, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.21649539470672607, "description_category_runtime": 9.392, "description_subcategory": "Valuation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5742116570472717, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.36, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.21649539470672607, "subcategory": "Valuation", "subcategory_score": 0.5742116570472717, "runtime_cat": 23.752, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.701", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975024760093", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "think save say everyone taking part competition problem validation local cv score represent leaderboard score people even described negative correlation supposed solve problem without idea model good without submitting leaderboard first keep mind public lb evaluated 50 data find better way local validation kernel try different technique wouldnt dare call better thoroughly evaluated certainly interesting", "tags_descriptive": []}
