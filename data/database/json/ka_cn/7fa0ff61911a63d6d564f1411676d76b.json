{"title": "iMaterialist: Object Detection + Colors + EDA", "description": "Extensive EDA of iMaterialist (Fashion) Dataset with Object Detection and Color AnalysisThis notebook contains the exploration of iMaterialist Challenge (Fashion) at FGVC5 dataset About the iMaterialist (Fashion) Competition - As shoppers move online, it would be a dream come true to have products in photos classified automatically. But, automatic product recognition is tough because for the same product, a picture can be taken in different lighting, angles, backgrounds, and levels of occlusion. Meanwhile different fine-grained categories may look very similar, for example, royal blue vs turquoise in color. Many of today\u2019s general-purpose recognition machines simply cannot perceive such subtle differences between photos, yet these differences could be important for shopping decisions. Tackling issues like this is why the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) has put together a workshop specifically for data scientists focused on fine-grained visual categorization called the FGVC5 workshop. As part of this workshop, CVPR is partnering with Google, Wish, and Malong Technologies to challenge the data science community to help push the state of the art in automatic image classification. In this competition, FGVC workshop organizers with Wish and Malong Technologies challenge you to develop algorithms that will help with an important step towards automatic product detection \u2013 to accurately assign attribute labels for fashion images. Individuals/Teams with top submissions will be invited to present their work live at the FGVC5 workshop. Contents 1.
