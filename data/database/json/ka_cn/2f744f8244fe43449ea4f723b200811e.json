{"title": "PIL vs Opencv", "description": "Fast benchmark: Pillow vs OpenCVBackground: when we deal with images in image-based problems and deploy a deep learning solution, it is better to have a fast image reading and transforming library. Let's compare Pillow and OpenCV python libraries on image loading and some basic transformations on source images from Carvana competition. OpenCV: C++, python-wrapper Pillow: Python, C  Intuition says that Opencv should be a little faster, let's see this by examples  This question I asked myself after reading the PyTorch documentation on image transformation. Most of transformations take as input a PIL image.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/vfdev5/pil-vs-opencv", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["Pillow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-10-13 15:24:26", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:38:33", "words": 95, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.14708369970321655, "description_category_runtime": 9.477, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6888920664787292, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.822, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.14708369970321655, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6888920664787292, "runtime_cat": 24.3, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.803", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967539417187", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "fast benchmark pillow v opencvbackground deal image imagebased problem deploy deep learning solution better fast image reading transforming library let compare pillow opencv python library image loading basic transformation source image carvana competition opencv c pythonwrapper pillow python c intuition say opencv little faster let see example question asked reading pytorch documentation image transformation transformation take input pil image", "tags_descriptive": []}
