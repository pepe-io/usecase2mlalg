{"title": "OOP approach to FE and models", "description": "General informationIn this kernel I work with data from 2019 Data Science Bowl Challenge. This is quite an interesting data about children playing educational games. We need to predict how will a user perform in the next assessment. I have decided to try a different approach to feature engineering and modelling in this kernel - most of the code will be written in classes for better usability and reproducibility. These are my first attempts to do it on Kaggle, so the code may evolve into something different in the future.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/oop-approach-to-fe-and-models", "tags": ["Classification", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-11-18 04:13:16", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:40:29", "words": 90, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.24203985929489136, "description_category_runtime": 7.733, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9910127520561218, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.415, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.24203985929489136, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9910127520561218, "runtime_cat": 20.149, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.749", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958936816976", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general informationin kernel work data 2019 data science bowl challenge quite interesting data child playing educational game need predict user perform next assessment decided try different approach feature engineering modelling kernel code written class better usability reproducibility first attempt kaggle code may evolve something different future", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering"]}
