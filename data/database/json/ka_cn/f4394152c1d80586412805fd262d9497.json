{"title": "Beating CVxTz very good code (0.38) to 0.42", "description": "Hi, I'm happy to share some improvements. I hope it will be helpfull, as kernel of CVxTz was helpfull for me : https://www.kaggle.com/CVxTz/beating-the-baseline-keras-lb-0-38 So a big thanks to CVxTz for the very good code and to Nastika Vidwan, with their introduction of face recognition and triplet loss concepts. I'm just adding below an improvement of the last part of CVxTz'code. I suggest to replace \"Nearest Neighbor\" approach by a direct distance calculation. It boost the score of about 0,04 (from 0.38 to 0.42).  So you don't have any excuse to attend the 5th place in the challenge ...  :-) Now i'm working on other improvements, but it's now a bit difficult because of poor number of occurences of classes ... have fun :-)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/bibuml/beating-cvxtz-very-good-code-0-38-to-0-42", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-02-24 14:49:21", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:17:20", "words": 125, "sentences": 8, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.30517685413360596, "description_category_runtime": 13.741, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5533920526504517, "description_subcategory_runtime": 22.071, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.30517685413360596, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5533920526504517, "runtime_cat": 35.812, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.646", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999982007603104", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "hi im happy share improvement hope helpfull kernel cvxtz helpfull httpswwwkagglecomcvxtzbeatingthebaselinekeraslb038 big thanks cvxtz good code nastika vidwan introduction face recognition triplet loss concept im adding improvement last part cvxtzcode suggest replace nearest neighbor approach direct distance calculation boost score 004 038 042 dont excuse attend 5th place challenge im working improvement bit difficult poor number occurences class fun", "tags_descriptive": []}
