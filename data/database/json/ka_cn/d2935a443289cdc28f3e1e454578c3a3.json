{"title": "Cutmix vs Mixup vs Gridmask vs Cutout", "description": "About this notebook....This notebook give the overview of how to perform cutmix, mixup, Gridmask and Cutout data augmentation. And analyse the performance of AUgmentation. Augmentation help to improve model performance, but it depend on various things, like what is the problem statement, Which Augmentation help to improve the performance, Ratio of Augmentation etc... If you find it helpful please upvote it.
