{"title": "Monsters First Submission", "description": "Monsters First CompThis is my first notebook on Kaggle.  I am creating it to explore the Kaggle environment.  Newcomers to Kaggle follow along with me as I learn how to use a Kaggle notebook.  I am also very new to machine learning and this looked like a fairly easy data set to start with So I am going to play with a few different classifiers. I found it very cool how SciKit Learn works and how easy it is to plug in a different classifier.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/quadmx08/monsters-first-submission", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-11-12 15:19:48", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:12:33", "words": 88, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.40415045619010925, "description_category_runtime": 8.319, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.950293779373169, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.697, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.40415045619010925, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.950293779373169, "runtime_cat": 21.017, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.639", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999986563897809", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "monster first compthis first notebook kaggle creating explore kaggle environment newcomer kaggle follow along learn use kaggle notebook also new machine learning looked like fairly easy data set start going play different classifier found cool scikit learn work easy plug different classifier", "tags_descriptive": []}
