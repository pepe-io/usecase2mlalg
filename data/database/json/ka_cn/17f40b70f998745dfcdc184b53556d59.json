{"title": "A Neural CNN Game of Life with Keras", "description": "Why CNNs?the fundamental of this problem deals with surrounding blocks. Kernels in CNNs are better suited for this task as they can sense the changes in surrounding blocks. => less filters with added sense of sequences. Adding a sense of Seqence to the NetworkMaybe combine CNN+LSTM or something new", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/parmarsuraj99/a-neural-cnn-game-of-life-with-keras", "tags": ["DL", "Feature Engineering", "Keras"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-09 12:08:35", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:58:02", "words": 49, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.3117229640483856, "description_category_runtime": 5.517, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7698397636413574, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.043, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.3117229640483856, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7698397636413574, "runtime_cat": 14.56, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.626", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974579658423", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "cnnsthe fundamental problem deal surrounding block kernel cnns better suited task sense change surrounding block le filter added sense sequence adding sense seqence networkmaybe combine cnnlstm something new", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Feature Engineering", "Keras"]}
