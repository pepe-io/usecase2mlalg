{"title": "ALASKA2 Stacking GPU & TPU Models - A Starter Kit", "description": "OverviewThis notebook provides a baseline stacking framework with TPU and GPU models. I did not include my best weights here as there is no free lunch in this world. An important point to note is that the TPU weights are trained with TensorFlow wheres the GPU ones are with PyTorch! The stacking methods shown here are:  mean median min-max mean min-max median pushout-median  My public GPU and TPU weights for EfficientNetb0 to b7 can be found here:https://www.kaggle.com/khoongweihao/alaska2-efficientnet-trained-model-weights. The weights will be updated periodically to reflect my progress in the competition.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/khoongweihao/alaska2-stacking-gpu-tpu-models-a-starter-kit", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch", "albumentations"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-23 11:48:42", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:29:24", "words": 92, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.09295178204774857, "description_category_runtime": 11.109, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9767780900001526, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.817, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.09295178204774857, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9767780900001526, "runtime_cat": 27.927, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.691", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999985965635988", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewthis notebook provides baseline stacking framework tpu gpu model include best weight free lunch world important point note tpu weight trained tensorflow wheres gpu one pytorch stacking method shown mean median minmax mean minmax median pushoutmedian public gpu tpu weight efficientnetb0 b7 found herehttpswwwkagglecomkhoongweihaoalaska2efficientnettrainedmodelweights weight updated periodically reflect progress competition", "tags_descriptive": []}
