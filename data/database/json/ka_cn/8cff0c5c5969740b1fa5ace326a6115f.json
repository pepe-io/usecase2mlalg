{"title": "More Text Cleaning To Increase Word Coverage", "description": "In this notebook, I am going to sharing some text cleaning mostly based on bad case analyse. The cleaning methods include:  remove empty space replace strange punctuations and raplace diacritics clean numbers, split numbers and letters de-contract the contraction clean math latex clean many misspelling words spacing punctuations expect -and . fix -and . punc spacing bugs which common kernels existed spacing some connected words like whatis, whichcountry clean repeated letters in one word, like hoooooow clean some masked words like f***, st*up*id  Reference:  How to: Preprocessing when using embeddings Improve your Score with some Text Preprocessing  Cleaning text data has caused me huge time!
