{"title": "ArcFace + GeM + Train on TPU", "description": "In this notebook, I will show you Tensorflow implementation of ArcFace layer, GeM pooling layer and how to train everything on TPU.TPU must read and store data from/to Google cloud storage. Although you could access input data in this gs dir: KaggleDatasets().get_gcs_path(), I would recommand you to shard and serialise the data beforehand using this script from DELF repo. Afterwards you should upload shards to your google cloud storage and uses tf.data.TFRecordDataset to load them. It can increase your training time by 4x. Here I will continue as data has been sharded and serialised.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/suruili/arcface-gem-train-on-tpu", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "pytorch", "tensorflow", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-31 13:56:57", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:53:48", "words": 94, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.2050018161535263, "description_category_runtime": 10.348, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8986788988113403, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.121, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.2050018161535263, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8986788988113403, "runtime_cat": 26.469, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.695", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997522819233", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook show tensorflow implementation arcface layer gem pooling layer train everything tputpu must read store data fromto google cloud storage although could access input data g dir kaggledatasetsget_gcs_path would recommand shard serialise data beforehand using script delf repo afterwards upload shard google cloud storage us tfdatatfrecorddataset load increase training time 4x continue data sharded serialised", "tags_descriptive": []}
