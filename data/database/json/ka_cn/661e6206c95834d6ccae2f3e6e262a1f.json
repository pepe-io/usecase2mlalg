We will try to build network with multichannel input, because this case is so difficult for novice. Plan:  Explanation of model\u2019s usefulness How to develop a neural network with multichannel input in Keras. Practice: using this approach in DonorsChoose Competition  Let's start! Explanation of model\u2019s usefulnessImagine, we have a dataset of images and we need to solve the problem of classification. Probably, we will develop a convolutional neural network. What are you going to do, in order to supplement meta data (texts, some categorical features and etc.) in model? Obviously, we need different types of NN for different types of data, e.g. RNN, CNN and etc. But NN with multichannel input allows to create ONE NN, which could merge all different types of needed NNs. It could divide different flows of calculation, and then merge them together inside one joint NN. How to develop a neural network with multichannel input in Keras. Firts of all, we define the type of each data and choose apropriate type of NN for each type of data.  Then, we develop each NN. By class concatenate of module layers.merge in Keras we merge all outputs of these different NNs Enjoy! :)   That's all! Practice: using this approach in DonorsChoose Competition </a>0.
