We will build a prediction model to predict which team wins for all combination of possible matchup. Large amount of historical data about college basketball games and teams are provided. This is 2 stage competition:  Stage 1 - You should submit predicted probabilities for every possible matchup in the past 5 NCAA\u00ae tournaments (seasons 2015-2019). Stage 2 - You should submit predicted probabilities for every possible matchup before the 2020 tournament begins.  I will also demonstrate how to get logloss=0 score for stage1.
