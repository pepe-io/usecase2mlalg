{"title": "3rd Place Solution Part", "description": "3rd Place Solution Part: BestGuess + OptimizerMain architecture:  Hi all, thanks for the really interesting competition. I quickly want to share my solution. It is split up into 2 main blocks:  BestGuess, which is an iterative neural network approach. It predicts the start state for delta=1. Repeating it delta times for delta>1 And an Optimizer, which picks a random 3x3 reagion in the input, tries every possible combination of the 3x3 grid at once and selects randomly between the ones which produce the lowest score. It is entirely implemented on the GPU.  This approach reached a score of 0.018 before merging.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/markuskarmann/3rd-place-solution-part", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-12-05 04:08:07", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:58:02", "words": 104, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.17577099800109863, "description_category_runtime": 10.246, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8986807465553284, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.789, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.17577099800109863, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8986807465553284, "runtime_cat": 26.035, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.587", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999976170930707", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "3rd place solution part bestguess optimizermain architecture hi thanks really interesting competition quickly want share solution split 2 main block bestguess iterative neural network approach predicts start state delta1 repeating delta time delta1 optimizer pick random 3x3 reagion input try every possible combination 3x3 grid selects randomly one produce lowest score entirely implemented gpu approach reached score 0018 merging", "tags_descriptive": []}
