{"title": "U-Net Model with submission", "description": "OverviewWe try here to improve another public U-Net model: https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/baseline-u-net-model-part-1 which shows how to extract the segmentation map for the ships, augment the images and train a simple DNN model to detect them. A few additional tweaks like balancing the ship-count out a little better have also been done. We are using a different loss function (closer to the competition scoring) and also fix and improve some visualisation functions and the submission itself.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/hmendonca/u-net-model-with-submission", "tags": ["CNN"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-10-02 20:16:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:28:05", "words": 73, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.10172387212514877, "description_category_runtime": 8.769, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9136142134666443, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.974, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.10172387212514877, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9136142134666443, "runtime_cat": 21.743, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.779", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999976182590198", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewwe try improve another public unet model httpswwwkagglecomkmaderbaselineunetmodelpart1 show extract segmentation map ship augment image train simple dnn model detect additional tweak like balancing shipcount little better also done using different loss function closer competition scoring also fix improve visualisation function submission", "tags_descriptive": ["Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
