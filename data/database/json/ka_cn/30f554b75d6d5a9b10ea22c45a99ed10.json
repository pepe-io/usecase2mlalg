{"title": "Recurrence relation", "description": "Summary:This notebook uses elementary math methods to detect linear recurrence sequences.  Machine learning methods are not used here. Among the 113,849 sequenes in the test set, we found more than 5000 of them satify recurrence relations of order 2,3 or 4. For those sequences, we computed the recurrence relations and predict the next terms. Moreover, we found recurrence relations that are not described in the OEIS. Linear Recurrence Relations(Remark: This notebook only considers homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients. Nonlinear or non-homogeneous relations are not investigated here.) 2nd order recurrence relationA second order recurrence relation is of the form:  an+2=c0an+c1an+1, where the coefficients c0 and c1 are constant. For example, the Fibonacci sequence an+2=an+an+1 is a second order recurrence sequence with coefficients (1,1). 3rd order recurrence relationA second order recurrence relation is of the form:  an+3=c0an+c1an+1+c2an+2, where the coefficients c0,c1,c2 are constant. Detect Recurrence RelationsGiven a sequence an, let's say we want to verify whether it's given by a 3rd order recurrence relation. In other words, we check if it's possible to find constants c0,c1,c2 so that an+3=c0an+c1an+1+c2an+2 is satified. To find possible c0,c1,c2, since there are 3 unknowns, we need at least 3 equations. Let's set the equations using a3,a4,a5 as follows: a3=c0a0+c1a1+c2a2a4=c0a1+c1a2+c2a3a5=c0a2+c1a3+c2a4.Writting these equations in matrix form, we obtain [a0a1a2a1a2a3a2a3a4][c0c1c2]=[a3a4a5], then we solve for (c0,c1,c2). Once the coefficients (c0,c1,c2) are found, we check whether the next terms a6,a7,\u22ef satisfy the recurrence relation.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/ncchen/recurrence-relation", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-06-20 15:40:42", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 11:57:13", "words": 238, "sentences": 14, "sum_nltk": "Summary:This notebook uses elementary math methods to detect linear recurrence sequences.\nAmong the 113,849 sequenes in the test set, we found more than 5000 of them satify recurrence relations of order 2,3 or 4.\nFor those sequences, we computed the recurrence relations and predict the next terms.\nLinear Recurrence Relations(Remark: This notebook only considers homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\nNonlinear or non-homogeneous relations are not investigated here.) 2nd order recurrence relationA second order recurrence relation is of the form:  an+2=c0an+c1an+1, where the coefficients c0 and c1 are constant.\nFor example, the Fibonacci sequence an+2=an+an+1 is a second order recurrence sequence with coefficients (1,1).\n3rd order recurrence relationA second order recurrence relation is of the form:  an+3=c0an+c1an+1+c2an+2, where the coefficients c0,c1,c2 are constant.\nDetect Recurrence RelationsGiven a sequence an, let's say we want to verify whether it's given by a 3rd order recurrence relation.\nIn other words, we check if it's possible to find constants c0,c1,c2 so that an+3=c0an+c1an+1+c2an+2 is satified.\nLet's set the equations using a3,a4,a5 as follows: a3=c0a0+c1a1+c2a2a4=c0a1+c1a2+c2a3a5=c0a2+c1a3+c2a4.Writting these equations in matrix form, we obtain [a0a1a2a1a2a3a2a3a4][c0c1c2]=[a3a4a5], then we solve for (c0,c1,c2).\nOnce the coefficients (c0,c1,c2) are found, we check whether the next terms a6,a7,\u22ef satisfy the recurrence relation.", "sum_nltk_words": 193, "sum_nltk_runtime": 0.003, "sum_t5": "a notebook uses elementary math methods to detect linear recurrence sequences. recurrence relations that are not described in the OEIS are not investigated. the notebook only considers homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients. the results are presented in a saturday paper. back to mail online home. back to the page you came from.. back to the page you came from.", "sum_t5_words": 61, "sum_t5_runtime": 6.381, "runtime": 0.0, "nltk_category": "Utilities", "nltk_category_score": 0.5727593898773193, "nltk_category_runtime": 33.139, "nltk_subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "nltk_subcategory_score": 0.7095469236373901, "nltk_subcategory_runtime": 54.659, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.5727593898773193, "subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "subcategory_score": 0.7095469236373901, "runtime_cat": 87.798, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.756", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975046947627", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "summarythis notebook us elementary math method detect linear recurrence sequence machine learning method used among 113849 sequenes test set found 5000 satify recurrence relation order 23 4 sequence computed recurrence relation predict next term moreover found recurrence relation described oeis linear recurrence relationsremark notebook considers homogeneous linear recurrence relation constant coefficient nonlinear nonhomogeneous relation investigated 2nd order recurrence relationa second order recurrence relation form an2c0anc1an1 coefficient c0 c1 constant example fibonacci sequence an2anan1 second order recurrence sequence coefficient 11 3rd order recurrence relationa second order recurrence relation form an3c0anc1an1c2an2 coefficient c0c1c2 constant detect recurrence relationsgiven sequence let say want verify whether given 3rd order recurrence relation word check possible find constant c0c1c2 an3c0anc1an1c2an2 satified find possible c0c1c2 since 3 unknown need least 3 equation let set equation using a3a4a5 follows a3c0a0c1a1c2a2a4c0a1c1a2c2a3a5c0a2c1a3c2a4writting equation matrix form obtain a0a1a2a1a2a3a2a3a4c0c1c2a3a4a5 solve c0c1c2 coefficient c0c1c2 found check whether next term a6a7 satisfy recurrence relation", "tags_descriptive": []}
