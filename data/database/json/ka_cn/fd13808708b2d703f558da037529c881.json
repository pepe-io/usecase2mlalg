{"title": "Extensive Text Data Feature Engineering", "description": "IntroductionThis is a feature engineering notebook for the DonorsChoose.org Application Screening competition. The objective is to predict whether teachers' project proposals are accepted or rejected. In this notebook, I have described different types of features that can be engineered with the given dataset. These features can be used in the classification models.
