{"title": "Cropping with normlized aspect ratio", "description": "Hello gens, I've tried to process images with croping and normalizing aspect ratio. There are two idea for the task  Find object boundary and crop by a window with the most amount of boundary Train 'whale tail' or 'background' by CNN with keras and zoom image by its probability.  Even though the images are already cropped as we can easily find the object (whale tail), these have indifferent information. So, I'd like to scrape off. In addition, the aspect ratio of cropped area should be normalized for inputting to Keras model.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/rio114/cropping-with-normlized-aspect-ratio", "tags": ["CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-06-14 04:14:22", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:17:20", "words": 93, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.36524540185928345, "description_category_runtime": 8.977, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9301927089691162, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.568, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.36524540185928345, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9301927089691162, "runtime_cat": 22.545, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.714", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968137088073", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "hello gen ive tried process image croping normalizing aspect ratio two idea task find object boundary crop window amount boundary train whale tail background cnn kera zoom image probability even though image already cropped easily find object whale tail indifferent information id like scrape addition aspect ratio cropped area normalized inputting kera model", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)"]}
