{"title": "Unrolling of helices + outliers removal", "description": "This python notebook inspired in Grzegorz Sionkowsk algorithm to initialize the clusters with DBSCAN. After the initialization there is a post processing of clusters using  some ideas of the paper Fitting helices to data by total least squares by Yves Nievergelt and thresholds of minimum and maximum clusters sizes. The method to determine if a set of points in space fits in a helix is shown below", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mindcool/unrolling-of-helices-outliers-removal", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-07-19 19:32:13", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:43:27", "words": 68, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.30395546555519104, "description_category_runtime": 7.086, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8729905486106873, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.755, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.30395546555519104, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8729905486106873, "runtime_cat": 17.842, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.754", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999960352663742", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "python notebook inspired grzegorz sionkowsk algorithm initialize cluster dbscan initialization post processing cluster using idea paper fitting helix data total least square yves nievergelt threshold minimum maximum cluster size method determine set point space fit helix shown", "tags_descriptive": []}
