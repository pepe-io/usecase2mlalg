{"title": "Unsupervised Masks - CV 0.60", "description": "Unsupervised Masks - CV 0.60In this kernel, we create segmentation masks without using the annotators' training masks! Instead we build a classifier to classify images into Fish, Flower, Gravel, and Sugar. By looking at hundreds of images of Fish, the CNN learns to recognize Fish in the images. Even though we don't tell the network what specifically is a Fish within the image, the CNN determines where and what Fish are by understanding the similarity between many images containing Fish. This feels like magic! There is a great blog why this works here. Some of this notebook's code was taken from the blogger's GitHub here", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/unsupervised-masks-cv-0-60", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-11-05 21:56:09", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:07:53", "words": 105, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.3095592260360718, "description_category_runtime": 9.561, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9730217456817627, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.869, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.3095592260360718, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9730217456817627, "runtime_cat": 24.43, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.685", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999973143973153", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "unsupervised mask cv 060in kernel create segmentation mask without using annotator training mask instead build classifier classify image fish flower gravel sugar looking hundred image fish cnn learns recognize fish image even though dont tell network specifically fish within image cnn determines fish understanding similarity many image containing fish feel like magic great blog work notebook code taken blogger github", "tags_descriptive": []}
