{"title": "Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme - Getting Started", "description": "Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme - Getting StartedIntroductionBengali is the 5th most spoken language in the world with hundreds of million of speakers. Optical character recognition is particularly challenging for Bengali. While Bengali has 49 letters (to be more specific 11 vowels and 38 consonants) in its alphabet, there are also 18 potential diacritics, or accents. This means that there are many more graphemes, or the smallest units in a written language. The added complexity results in ~13,000 different grapheme variations (compared to English\u2019s 250 graphemic units). Bangladesh-based non-profit Bengali.AI is focused on helping to solve this problem. They build and release crowdsourced, metadata-rich datasets and open source them through research competitions. Through this work, Bengali.AI hopes to democratize and accelerate research in Bengali language technologies and to promote machine learning education. For this competition, we are given the image of a handwritten Bengali grapheme and are challenged to separately classify three constituent elements in the image: grapheme root, vowel diacritics, and consonant diacritics.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/bengali-ai-handwritten-grapheme-getting-started", "tags": ["CV", "Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-01-25 19:21:35", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:09:20", "words": 162, "sentences": 9, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.7343729138374329, "description_category_runtime": 16.999, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6893107295036316, "description_subcategory_runtime": 27.132, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.7343729138374329, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.6893107295036316, "runtime_cat": 44.13, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.729", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997599487102", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "bengaliai handwritten grapheme getting startedintroductionbengali 5th spoken language world hundred million speaker optical character recognition particularly challenging bengali bengali 49 letter specific 11 vowel 38 consonant alphabet also 18 potential diacritic accent mean many grapheme smallest unit written language added complexity result 13000 different grapheme variation compared english 250 graphemic unit bangladeshbased nonprofit bengaliai focused helping solve problem build release crowdsourced metadatarich datasets open source research competition work bengaliai hope democratize accelerate research bengali language technology promote machine learning education competition given image handwritten bengali grapheme challenged separately classify three constituent element image grapheme root vowel diacritic consonant diacritic", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)", "Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
