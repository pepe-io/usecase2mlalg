{"title": "Python target encoding for categorical features", "description": "Target encoding with smoothingmin_samples_leaf define a threshold where prior and target mean (for a given category value) have the same weight. Below the threshold prior becomes more important and above mean becomes more important. How weight behaves against value counts is controlled by smoothing parameter", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/ogrellier/python-target-encoding-for-categorical-features", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-11-11 16:46:50", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 15:44:39", "words": 45, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.4886491298675537, "description_category_runtime": 5.164, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6390658020973206, "description_subcategory_runtime": 7.757, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.4886491298675537, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.6390658020973206, "runtime_cat": 12.921, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.811", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958233279322", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "target encoding smoothingmin_samples_leaf define threshold prior target mean given category value weight threshold prior becomes important mean becomes important weight behaves value count controlled smoothing parameter", "tags_descriptive": []}
