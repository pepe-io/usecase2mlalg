{"title": "EDA with Python datatable", "description": "One of the main issues in this competition is the size of the dataset. Pandas crashes when attempting to load the entire train and test datasets at once. One of the kernels has been able to read the entire train dataset using dask. In this kernels we'll use Python datatable package to load the entire train and test datasets, and do some simple EDA on them. Python datatable is still in early alpha stage and is under very active curent development. It is designed from ground up for big datasets and with efficiency and speed in mind. It is closely related to R's data.table and attempts to mimic its core algorithams and API.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/eda-with-python-datatable", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "h2o"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-03 14:39:02", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:13:18", "words": 113, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.20020340383052826, "description_category_runtime": 9.629, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5648709535598755, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.851, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.20020340383052826, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5648709535598755, "runtime_cat": 24.481, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.728", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984300487783", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "one main issue competition size dataset panda crash attempting load entire train test datasets one kernel able read entire train dataset using dask kernel well use python datatable package load entire train test datasets simple eda python datatable still early alpha stage active curent development designed ground big datasets efficiency speed mind closely related r datatable attempt mimic core algorithams api", "tags_descriptive": []}
