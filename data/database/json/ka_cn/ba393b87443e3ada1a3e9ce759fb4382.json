{"title": "Computer Vision Fundamentals", "description": "IntroYou don't directly choose the numbers to go into your convolutions for deep learning... instead the deep learning technique determines what convolutions will be useful from the data (as part of model-training). We'll come back to how the model does that soon.  But looking closely at convolutions and how they are applied to your image will improve your intuition for these models, how they work, and how to debug them when they don't work. Let's get started. ExercisesWe'll use some small utilty functions to visualize raw images and some results of your code. Execute the next cell to load the utility functions.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/salmaneunus/computer-vision-fundamentals", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-08 01:04:01", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:55:48", "words": 103, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.5247862339019775, "description_category_runtime": 9.522, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.33089759945869446, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.041, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.5247862339019775, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.33089759945869446, "runtime_cat": 24.564, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.532", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978745331208", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introyou dont directly choose number go convolution deep learning instead deep learning technique determines convolution useful data part modeltraining well come back model soon looking closely convolution applied image improve intuition model work debug dont work let get started exerciseswell use small utilty function visualize raw image result code execute next cell load utility function", "tags_descriptive": []}
