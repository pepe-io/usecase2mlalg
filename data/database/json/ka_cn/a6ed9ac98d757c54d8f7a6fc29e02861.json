{"title": "Investigate Missing Values", "description": "First things first: I have some data analysis background from my research career in particle physics, but I am far from being an machine learning expert. So please bear with me and I am happy to receive any kind of feedback. Since the training data set (and possibly the test data as well) contain missing data, I wanted to have a closer look at this issue. I have seen that other participants propose to fill those NaNs with the mean or median for the respective column. Here I am not (yet) that much interested in filling the blanks but I rather want to know whether we can learn something more about the data when looking missing values.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/cgump3rt/investigate-missing-values", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-01-10 23:32:59", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:01:01", "words": 117, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.3204316794872284, "description_category_runtime": 9.648, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6672484278678894, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.149, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.3204316794872284, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6672484278678894, "runtime_cat": 24.796, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.746", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972728446541", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "first thing first data analysis background research career particle physic far machine learning expert please bear happy receive kind feedback since training data set possibly test data well contain missing data wanted closer look issue seen participant propose fill nan mean median respective column yet much interested filling blank rather want know whether learn something data looking missing value", "tags_descriptive": []}
