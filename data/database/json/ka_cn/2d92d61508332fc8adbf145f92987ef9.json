{"title": "Aligned Timestamp - LGBM by meter type", "description": "This notebook is an implementation of @Fred Navruzov's Timestamp Alignment method to @corochann's kernel. The idea is to align the timestamp by peak air temperature, based on an assumption that the highest air temperature should appear at around 14:00. After aligning the timestamp of weather data, LB jumped from 1.12 to 1.11.
