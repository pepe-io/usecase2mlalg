{"title": "Lyft First Data Exploration", "description": "1. IntroductionThis is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Kernel for Lyft Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles competition dataset.  We start with the analysis preparation, which requires, for this competition, to install and load several packages for load and manage l5kit dataset. We follow with data exploration, reviewing the agents, the scenes, the frames and following with inspection of the animated scenes.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/lyft-first-data-exploration", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-11-16 14:08:03", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:21:26", "words": 62, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.0017955806106328964, "description_category_runtime": 6.724, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.26257771253585815, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.246, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.0017955806106328964, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.26257771253585815, "runtime_cat": 16.971, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.692", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999948023543516", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "1 introductionthis exploratory data analysis eda kernel lyft motion prediction autonomous vehicle competition dataset start analysis preparation requires competition install load several package load manage l5kit dataset follow data exploration reviewing agent scene frame following inspection animated scene", "tags_descriptive": []}
