{"title": "Fun Data Animation", "description": "How to Make an Animation!The data for the \"Don't Overfit! II\" competition has 300 features. Therefore it resides in 300 dimensional space and we have trouble visualizing it. In this kernel, we project it into 2 dimensional space and create an animation by rotating it through a third dimension. This visualization shows us that the training data target=1 and target=0 is separable by a hyperplane.
