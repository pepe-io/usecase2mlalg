Hi, I'm a semi-newbie who loves kaggle :) First, I would like to thank the Kaggle team and the Kagglers for conducting this survey. I am happy to be able to analyze these data. I've been preparing for an algorithm competition (such as ICPC) for about three years, and it's been about a year since I entered the DS/ML field. I love the sharing culture of AI, so I have some community managers in Korea, and I have a Facebook page.  My Facebook Page Background, made by me :)  I'm going to analyze / visualize what I'd be curious about as a newbie Kaggler. I am analyzing what I was wondering about, what frameworks are some people doing, and what frameworks are they using? I'm not as good at English as a native speaker. Therefore, I will replace some of the articles with highly readable visualizations. Invites you to a world of interactive and unusual visualizations. Please enjoy my kernel!!  img from https://giphy.com/gifs/friends-nick-at-nite-xT0BKiK5sOCVdBUhiM   Table of Contents Simple Distribution (Age, Gender, Country) Age & Gender Gender & Country Thinking About Gender imbalance     Which Algorithm Is Most Popular?
