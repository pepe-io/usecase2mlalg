This code takes true values and predicted probabilities, and selects the threshold/cutoff that yields the best MCC score. It is slower than the Python implementation, maybe someone can optimize this further, before trying to use it in xgboost or elsewhere.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/r-implementation-of-mcc-optimization", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["xgboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-09-22 20:55:33", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:31:53", "words": 58, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Manufacturing", "description_category_score": 0.2520166039466858, "description_category_runtime": 7.93, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.22635090351104736, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.487, "category": "Manufacturing", "category_score": 0.2520166039466858, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.22635090351104736, "runtime_cat": 20.417, "programming_language": "R notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.738", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999945852844028", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "matthew correlation coefficientwiki httpsenwikipediaorgwikimatthews_correlation_coefficient author vopani rimplementation cpmps fast mcc optimization originally anokas mcc optimization code code take true value predicted probability selects thresholdcutoff yield best mcc score slower python implementation maybe someone optimize trying use xgboost elsewhere", "tags_descriptive": []}
