{"title": "Proper Clustering with Facenet Embeddings + EDA", "description": "Proper Clustering with Facenet EmbeddingsThis kernel shows how to use facenet embeddings to cluster similar faces throughout the training data and create a safe validation strategy for trainining and validation splits. You can see below how to use PCA, T-SNE and DBSCAN to efficiently cluster high-dimensional data. The found clusters are exported and can be used to improve your training and validation split. Some of the code is borrowed from @carlossouza and @timesler kernels, so thanks heaps to both. However, the results with facenet seem considerably better and more consistent than what is showed on the original kernel.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/hmendonca/proper-clustering-with-facenet-embeddings-eda", "tags": ["DL", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "CLustering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-02-03 10:41:05", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:44:56", "words": 98, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.11063263565301895, "description_category_runtime": 10.141, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6757684350013733, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.433, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.11063263565301895, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6757684350013733, "runtime_cat": 25.575, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.751", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999981159496824", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "proper clustering facenet embeddingsthis kernel show use facenet embeddings cluster similar face throughout training data create safe validation strategy trainining validation split see use pca tsne dbscan efficiently cluster highdimensional data found cluster exported used improve training validation split code borrowed carlossouza timesler kernel thanks heap however result facenet seem considerably better consistent showed original kernel", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "CLustering"]}
