{"title": "Synthetic data for (next?) Instant Gratification", "description": "As of now, despite that only a few days have passed since this competition started, we know a lot about the structure of dataset. We know about ID's, splits, etc. etc. I tried to put everything we knew so far together and generate a synthetic train.csv dataset from scratch as similar as possible to Kaggle's train.csv. I then ran some EDA on it and also trained some of the public kernels on this synthetic dataset and compared the CV score to theirs. Hope you enjoy this kernel. Don't forget to upvote and share your opinions. First, we generate the dataset from 512 different classification datasets by using sklearn's make_calssification.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mhviraf/synthetic-data-for-next-instant-gratification", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-05-29 00:33:00", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 11:53:26", "words": 109, "sentences": 8, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.06124848499894142, "description_category_runtime": 10.1, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8130601048469543, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.232, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.06124848499894142, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8130601048469543, "runtime_cat": 26.332, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.728", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968641198597", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "despite day passed since competition started know lot structure dataset know id split etc etc tried put everything knew far together generate synthetic traincsv dataset scratch similar possible kaggles traincsv ran eda also trained public kernel synthetic dataset compared cv score hope enjoy kernel dont forget upvote share opinion first generate dataset 512 different classification datasets using sklearns make_calssification", "tags_descriptive": []}
