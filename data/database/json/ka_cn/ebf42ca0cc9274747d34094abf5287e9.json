{"title": "Cats and Dogs with Rapids t-SNE", "description": "Rapids is an open-source GPU accelerated Data Science and Machine Learning library, developed and mainatained by Nvidia. It is designed to be compatible with many existing CPU tools, such as Pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc. It enables massive acceleration of many data-science and machine learning tasks, oftentimes by a factor fo 100X, or more. Rapids is still undergoing developemnt, and as of right now it's not availabel in the Kaggle Docker environment. If you are interested in installing and running Rapids locally on your own machine, then you should refer to the followong instructions. The purpose of this kernel is to take a look at dimensionality reduction that one gets with t-SNE algorithms. We will apply these algorithms to various image embeddings done with top pretrained Deep Learnign architectures.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/cats-and-dogs-with-rapids-t-sne", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["xgboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-10-13 15:06:56", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:58:25", "words": 128, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.17608825862407684, "description_category_runtime": 12.628, "description_subcategory": "Judicial Applied", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4771805703639984, "description_subcategory_runtime": 19.501, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.17608825862407684, "subcategory": "Judicial Applied", "subcategory_score": 0.4771805703639984, "runtime_cat": 32.13, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.589", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977672390986", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "rapid opensource gpu accelerated data science machine learning library developed mainatained nvidia designed compatible many existing cpu tool panda scikitlearn numpy etc enables massive acceleration many datascience machine learning task oftentimes factor fo 100x rapid still undergoing developemnt right availabel kaggle docker environment interested installing running rapid locally machine refer followong instruction purpose kernel take look dimensionality reduction one get tsne algorithm apply algorithm various image embeddings done top pretrained deep learnign architecture", "tags_descriptive": []}
