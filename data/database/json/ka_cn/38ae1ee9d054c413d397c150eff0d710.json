In the subsequent kernel I am using the PCA algorithm in order to gain further insights into the various atom-configurations contained in the xyz-files. I hope that this might be a help for you in order to explore new features which advance you in the underlying problem statement. I like to add that I am not a domain expert in the chemistry field.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/maxkapsecker/pca-pattern-discovery", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-31 12:58:03", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:37:12", "words": 65, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Emergency & Relief", "description_category_score": 0.048886168748140335, "description_category_runtime": 6.447, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.33395686745643616, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.536, "category": "Emergency & Relief", "category_score": 0.048886168748140335, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.33395686745643616, "runtime_cat": 15.983, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.685", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999998153138965", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "hey guy subsequent kernel using pca algorithm order gain insight various atomconfigurations contained xyzfiles hope might help order explore new feature advance underlying problem statement like add domain expert chemistry field", "tags_descriptive": []}
