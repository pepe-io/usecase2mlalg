{"title": "Predict NCAA Basketball 2017 (.491782)", "description": "Predict NCAA Basketball 2017 Here we will use Logistic Regression to predict the outcomes of every possible matchup in the 2017 March Madness basketball tournament.  Our classifier will make its decision based off of the values for 17 features.  One important feature is a ranking metric called ELO (Link #1, Link #2) while the remaining 16 features are traditional basketball metrics (described below).
