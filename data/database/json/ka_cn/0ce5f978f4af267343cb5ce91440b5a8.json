{"title": "Processing BSON Files", "description": "The bson files for this competition contain a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per product. Each dictionary contains a product id (key: _id), the category id of the product (key: category_id), and between 1-4 images, stored in a list (key: imgs). Each image list contains a single dictionary per image, which uses the format: {'picture': b'...binary string...'}. The bson file can be read and processed iteratively. The following code shows how to read the data from the train_example.bson file.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/inversion/processing-bson-files", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-09-15 20:53:21", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:44:11", "words": 79, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.4213024377822876, "description_category_runtime": 8.962, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5337949395179749, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.657, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.4213024377822876, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.5337949395179749, "runtime_cat": 22.619, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.791", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999971431733011", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "bson file competition contain list dictionary one dictionary per product dictionary contains product id key _id category id product key category_id 14 image stored list key imgs image list contains single dictionary per image us format picture bbinary string bson file read processed iteratively following code show read data train_examplebson file", "tags_descriptive": []}
