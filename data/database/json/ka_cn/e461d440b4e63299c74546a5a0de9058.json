{"title": "CNN Baseline Model", "description": "In this kernel we will use a simple Convolutional Neural Network to tackle the problem at hand. CNNs are fast and produce adequate enough results, so this will serve as a pretty good baseline for more sophisticated architectures revolving around CNNs. Before we begin, we will set the seed for the components involved. That is, plain ol' Python, Numpy and Tensorflow.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/antmarakis/cnn-baseline-model", "tags": ["DL", "CNN"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-07-04 16:37:27", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:14:35", "words": 61, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.20775149762630463, "description_category_runtime": 6.321, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8616805672645569, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.707, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.20775149762630463, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8616805672645569, "runtime_cat": 16.028, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.731", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975132477074", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel use simple convolutional neural network tackle problem hand cnns fast produce adequate enough result serve pretty good baseline sophisticated architecture revolving around cnns begin set seed component involved plain ol python numpy tensorflow", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
