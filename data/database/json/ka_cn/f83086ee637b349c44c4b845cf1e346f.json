{"title": "Cloud Bounding Boxes - CV 0.58", "description": "Cloud Bounding Boxes - CV 0.58In this kernel we will attempt to create bounding boxes instead of segmentation. Currently the CV is a low 0.58 but perhaps this kernel can be improved to score higher. There is a variable TRAIN_MODELS below. If you set this variable to False then you can load oof and preds from offline training and predicting. Do this to save your GPU quota. If you want to see the models train and predict, then turn GPU on and set variable TRAIN_MODELS to True.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/cloud-bounding-boxes-lb-0-61", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-29 18:08:16", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:07:53", "words": 87, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.11456900089979172, "description_category_runtime": 8.686, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7398409247398376, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.158, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.11456900089979172, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7398409247398376, "runtime_cat": 21.845, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.677", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999966904274018", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "cloud bounding box cv 058in kernel attempt create bounding box instead segmentation currently cv low 058 perhaps kernel improved score higher variable train_models set variable false load oof preds offline training predicting save gpu quota want see model train predict turn gpu set variable train_models true", "tags_descriptive": []}
