Thus, I think we need to spend some time applying transformations to observations in the smaller classes in order to create a more balanced dataset for fitting. Find small classLet's find an extremely small class to work with, perhaps one with just one image.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mmrosenb/whales-some-image-processing", "tags": ["CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-01-13 22:47:06", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:17:20", "words": 59, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Media & Publishing", "description_category_score": 0.08130667358636856, "description_category_runtime": 6.039, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.3333759009838104, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.385, "category": "Media & Publishing", "category_score": 0.08130667358636856, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.3333759009838104, "runtime_cat": 15.425, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.671", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975351692838", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "motivationbased previous analysis apparent severe imbalanced class problem thus think need spend time applying transformation observation smaller class order create balanced dataset fitting find small classlets find extremely small class work perhaps one one image", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)"]}
