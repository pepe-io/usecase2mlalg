{"title": "Understanding the problem and some sample paths", "description": "In this kernel we try to get a basic understanding of the problem and explore a few simple solutions to see a how they differ.In case you haven't already figured it out, this is a version of the \"Traveling Salesman Problem\". May be the winning solution is going to be one of the very advanced approaches to that problem. But let us not get scared by an NP-Complete problem. We will start with some simple dumb approaches first and see where they lead us.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/seshadrikolluri/understanding-the-problem-and-some-sample-paths", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-06 08:24:27", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:50:09", "words": 84, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.010966001078486443, "description_category_runtime": 7.789, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.011598796583712101, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.911, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.010966001078486443, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.011598796583712101, "runtime_cat": 19.7, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.769", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999962847049976", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel try get basic understanding problem explore simple solution see differin case havent already figured version traveling salesman problem may winning solution going one advanced approach problem let u get scared npcomplete problem start simple dumb approach first see lead u", "tags_descriptive": []}
