Categorical Variables: Counting Eggs in the Age of Robotic ChickensThis chapter is one of the chapters of the book, Feature Engineering for Machine Learning. Since I do not have enough resource on my local machine, I have ended up creating this kernel to practice the source code of the chapter 5 while reading the book.
