Since this is my first kernel and moreover, and since english is not my mother tongue, please be indulgent. But any remarks/comments are welcome and appreciated. This notebook will described step-by-step the methods i have use to reduce dataframe memory and in particular focusing on this \"famous to be so big\" user_logs.csv. All methods presented here can be coupled with a \"transformation\" of the dataframe in an SQL DB or HDF-Storage.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/guiyom/user-logs-csv-reduce-memory-with-new-tips", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-11-06 19:18:33", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:29:18", "words": 94, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.14193573594093323, "description_category_runtime": 9.597, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5974863767623901, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.492, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.14193573594093323, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5974863767623901, "runtime_cat": 24.089, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.637", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999961539298463", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionthis kernel present new ml technique least focus different method reduce dataframe memory since first kernel moreover since english mother tongue please indulgent remarkscomments welcome appreciated notebook described stepbystep method use reduce dataframe memory particular focusing famous big user_logscsv method presented coupled transformation dataframe sql db hdfstorage", "tags_descriptive": []}
