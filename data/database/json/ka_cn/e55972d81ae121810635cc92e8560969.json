{"title": "Object Detection with Pytorch-Lightning", "description": "General information To get large and accurate data about wheat fields worldwide, plant scientists use image detection of \"wheat heads\"\u2014spikes atop the plant containing grain. These images are used to estimate the density and size of wheat heads in different varieties. Farmers can use the data to assess health and maturity when making management decisions in their fields. However, accurate wheat head detection in outdoor field images can be visually challenging. There is often overlap of dense wheat plants, and the wind can blur the photographs. Both make it difficult to identify single heads. Additionally, appearances vary due to maturity, color, genotype, and head orientation. Finally, because wheat is grown worldwide, different varieties, planting densities, patterns, and field conditions must be considered. In this competition we detect wheat heads on images and return coordinates of bboxes and their confidence. You can see a repository with code (can be run as a script) here: https://github.com/Erlemar/wheat The metric is IoU:  It is calculated at at different thresholds from 0.5 to 0.75 with a step size of 0.05. My kernel is based on official tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html and could intersect with this cool kernel by Peter: https://www.kaggle.com/pestipeti/pytorch-starter-fasterrcnn-train But this kernel I want to show you how to use Pytorch-Lightning framework for deep learning. I like the concept of this library and hope you will also find it useful.
