{"title": "Detecting cactus with kekas", "description": "General information Researchers in Mexico have created the VIGIA project, aiming to build a system for autonomous surveillance of protected areas. One of the first steps is being able to recognize the vegetation in the area. In this competition we are trying to identify whether there is a cactus in the image. In this kernel I use kekas (https://github.com/belskikh/kekas) as a wrapper for Pytorch. Most of the code is taken from my other kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/cancer-detection-with-kekas", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/detecting-cactus-with-kekas", "tags": ["DL", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch", "albumentations"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-04-10 21:28:50", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:10:46", "words": 75, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Agriculture", "description_category_score": 0.029607435688376427, "description_category_runtime": 9.233, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9841510653495789, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.088, "category": "Agriculture", "category_score": 0.029607435688376427, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9841510653495789, "runtime_cat": 23.321, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.737", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977291229141", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general information researcher mexico created vigia project aiming build system autonomous surveillance protected area one first step able recognize vegetation area competition trying identify whether cactus image kernel use kekas httpsgithubcombelskikhkekas wrapper pytorch code taken kernel httpswwwkagglecomartgorcancerdetectionwithkekas", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Classification"]}
