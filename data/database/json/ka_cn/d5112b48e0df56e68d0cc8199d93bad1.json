{"title": "Categorical Data encoding techniques", "description": "Problem Statement:- A common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables for a given algorithm in a format that allows as much useful signal as possible to be captured. We have to handle different types of categorical data columns using multiple techniques in order to get best results.  Lets begin. Types of categorical data given to us  binary features low- and high-cardinality nominal features low- and high-cardinality ordinal features (potentially) cyclical features", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/ruchibahl18/categorical-data-encoding-techniques", "tags": ["Classification", "Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-11-28 14:48:34", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:40:12", "words": 76, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.13211984932422638, "description_category_runtime": 7.709, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9722008109092712, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.813, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.13211984932422638, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9722008109092712, "runtime_cat": 19.523, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.679", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984459033388", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "problem statement common task machine learning pipeline encoding categorical variable given algorithm format allows much useful signal possible captured handle different type categorical data column using multiple technique order get best result let begin type categorical data given u binary feature low highcardinality nominal feature low highcardinality ordinal feature potentially cyclical feature", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Feature Engineering"]}
