{"title": "Supervised learning / Binary relevance", "description": "Introduction In this notebook, I will present the method I propose to make of this competition a supervised learning challenge. The only source of data I found and that I think it is relevant is the scientific paper stored in Springer. I used its API to create my training set. To create the model, I used binary relevance: I'm not sure it's the best way but everything in this notebook are open to debate.
