Competition ObjectiveIn the National Football League (NFL), roughly a third of teams\u2019 offensive yardage comes from run plays. A running play or rushing play is a tactic in which the football is advanced up the field by a player running it rather than passing it. Competition is to develop a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays as they happen.

Notebook objectiveObjective of the notebook is to explore the data and find some interesting insights along the way.
