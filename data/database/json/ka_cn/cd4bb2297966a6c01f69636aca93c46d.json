{"title": "EDA and Audio Processing with Python", "description": "Improving the accuracy of soundscape analyses.ObjectiveIt is often easier to hear birds than see them. With proper sound detection and classification, researchers could automatically intuit factors about an area\u2019s quality of life based on a changing bird population.The objective of the competition as stated on the competitions page is to identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. However, the recordings are complex and may contain anthropogenic sounds (e.g., airplane overflights) or other bird and non-bird (e.g., chipmunk) calls in the background, with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground. Understanding the Evaluation MetricThe metric in this competition is the row-wise micro averaged F1 score.The F1 score or F measure, is a measure of a test\u2019s accuracy. The F score is defined as the weighted harmonic mean of the test\u2019s precision and recall.  DataFollowing files have been provided to the participants:  train_audio : Trainign data consisting of short recordings train_csv : metadata for training data test_audio : The hidden test set audio consists of approximately 150 recordings in mp3 format, each                       roughly 10 minutes long.  test_audio.csv : metadata for test set.It is important to note that only the first three rows are available for download; the full test.csv is in the hidden test set.
