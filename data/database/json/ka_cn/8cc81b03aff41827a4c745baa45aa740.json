{"title": "TensorFlow Hub for Text Classification", "description": "TF-Hub is a platform to share machine learning expertise packaged in reusable resources, notably pre-trained modules. In this tutorial, we will use a TF-Hub text embedding module to train a simple sentiment classifier with a reasonable baseline accuracy. We will then submit the predictions to Kaggle. For more detailed tutorial on text classification with TF-Hub and further steps for improving the accuracy, take a look at Text classification with TF-Hub.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jeremiahharmsen/tensorflow-hub-for-text-classification", "tags": ["Transfer Learning"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-08-22 05:56:24", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:14:35", "words": 70, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.09262575954198837, "description_category_runtime": 7.399, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9584041237831116, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.162, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.09262575954198837, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9584041237831116, "runtime_cat": 18.561, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.734", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997945881114", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "tfhub platform share machine learning expertise packaged reusable resource notably pretrained module tutorial use tfhub text embedding module train simple sentiment classifier reasonable baseline accuracy submit prediction kaggle detailed tutorial text classification tfhub step improving accuracy take look text classification tfhub", "tags_descriptive": ["Transfer Learning"]}
