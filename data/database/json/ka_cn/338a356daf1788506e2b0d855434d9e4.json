{"title": "Text Data Clustering", "description": "Hi there! This is my first kernel dealing with textual data so any constructive feedabacks are higly appreciated. This dataset contains data of over 7 topics namely biology, robotics, cryptography, diy, travel, cooking, robotics and physics extracted from Stack Exchange. Each of these topics except physics have been classified as to which topic data belongs. So our task is to do predictions on unseen physics questions. Since our data won't be related to each other for example tags in travel won't be related to tags in cryptography hence I will be using unsupervised learning on physics dataset which is the test dataset.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/akshatpathak/text-data-clustering", "tags": ["CLustering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "nltk"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-09-03 14:16:37", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:46:50", "words": 102, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Physics", "description_category_score": 0.9636102318763733, "description_category_runtime": 9.124, "description_subcategory": "Physical", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5763777494430542, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.946, "category": "Physics", "category_score": 0.9636102318763733, "subcategory": "Physical", "subcategory_score": 0.5763777494430542, "runtime_cat": 23.071, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.718", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999981802006466", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "hi first kernel dealing textual data constructive feedabacks higly appreciated dataset contains data 7 topic namely biology robotics cryptography diy travel cooking robotics physic extracted stack exchange topic except physic classified topic data belongs task prediction unseen physic question since data wont related example tag travel wont related tag cryptography hence using unsupervised learning physic dataset test dataset", "tags_descriptive": ["CLustering"]}
