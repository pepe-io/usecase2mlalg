{"title": "Everyone Do this at the Beginning!!", "description": "You can remove 17 columns at the Beginning!!As the data is highly dimensional in this competition, it is really difficult to do even a little thing. So, before you begin any work, read this kernel and save your time! I have tried to reduce the column dimension by eliminating less useful columns and selected 17 columns which you can remove just after loading the data sets.  Selected mostly-missing feaures which have more than 99% of missing values. Selected too-skewed features whose majority categories cover more than 99% of occurences. Selected hightly-correlated features. Tested correlations between columns, picked up pairs whose corr is greater than 0.99, compared the distribution of the features in the pairs and corr with HasDetections,  and selected the minor column for elimination.  You can eliminate 17 columns without worry:  (M) PuaMode (M) Census_ProcessorClass (S) Census_IsWIMBootEnabled (S) IsBeta (S) Census_IsFlightsDisabled (S) Census_IsFlightingInternal (S) AutoSampleOptIn (S) Census_ThresholdOptIn (S) SMode (S) Census_IsPortableOperatingSystem (S) Census_DeviceFamily (S) UacLuaenable (S) Census_IsVirtualDevice (C) Platform (C) Census_OSSkuName (C) Census_OSInstallLanguageIdentifier (C) Processor  Here, (M) denotes mostly-missing feaures, (S) means  too-skewed features, and (C) indicates hightly-correlated features.
