{"title": "Naive Keras Cdiscount", "description": "This notebook is just a (very) small improvement over most common baseline. It loads a few images from train and resize it to 8x8 pixels to generate a 64 (8 x 8) feature vector. Then, it uses KNN to find the most similar image on test set. Unfortunatelly, due to limitations on Kernel, only a few test images are classified.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/bguberfain/naive-keras-cdiscount", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-09-16 04:30:17", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:44:11", "words": 60, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.06966698169708252, "description_category_runtime": 6.491, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5372545719146729, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.003, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.06966698169708252, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5372545719146729, "runtime_cat": 16.495, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.69", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999952479219758", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook small improvement common baseline load image train resize 8x8 pixel generate 64 8 x 8 feature vector us knn find similar image test set unfortunatelly due limitation kernel test image classified", "tags_descriptive": []}
