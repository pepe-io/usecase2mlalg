{"title": "COVID-19: Effect of temperature/humidity", "description": "COVID-19: Effect of temperature/humidity with visualizationThis kernel is inspired by the kernel COVID-19: Additional Statistics by @fanconic & @winterpierre91, which uses additional dataset to survey corona spread. Since it included global wheather information, I would like to focus on the relationship between wheather & corona to see if it has any effect or not. In conclusion, I could not find big relationship so far. In other words, corona's spread may not stop easily even though the global world temperature increases from April... [Note] weather information is until March 21, so this kernel investigates only until then. I might update this kernel to use daily updated wheather information if there's demand.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/corochann/covid-19-effect-of-temperature-humidity", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-04-03 00:23:03", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:11:58", "words": 110, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.11646512895822525, "description_category_runtime": 10.76, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2867981493473053, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.816, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.11646512895822525, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.2867981493473053, "runtime_cat": 27.577, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.726", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999995442665619", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "covid19 effect temperaturehumidity visualizationthis kernel inspired kernel covid19 additional statistic fanconic winterpierre91 us additional dataset survey corona spread since included global wheather information would like focus relationship wheather corona see effect conclusion could find big relationship far word corona spread may stop easily even though global world temperature increase april note weather information march 21 kernel investigates might update kernel use daily updated wheather information there demand", "tags_descriptive": []}
