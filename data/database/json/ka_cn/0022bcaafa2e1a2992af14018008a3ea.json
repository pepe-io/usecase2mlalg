Let's implement his world with object oriented programming? This migh help us develop cleaner code when searching for the best path for his deliveries. The CityThe lowest level we can get in his world are the cities. They have some properties:  x: the horizontal location on a map y: the vertical location on a map id: the city id, corresponds to the city name  From those basic properties we may create another one:  coord:  the tuple (x, y)  Then we may chek if a city is prime or not:  is_prime:  Boolean indication if is prime  Let's implement all that and see how it works:", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/andresionek/object-oriented-santa-s-route-concorde-solver", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-07 14:21:35", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:50:09", "words": 122, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.02261483669281006, "description_category_runtime": 10.825, "description_subcategory": "Transportation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.14901794493198395, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.097, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.02261483669281006, "subcategory": "Transportation", "subcategory_score": 0.14901794493198395, "runtime_cat": 27.922, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.726", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999970498513208", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "object oriented santa routesanta claus life wonderfull world let implement world object oriented programming migh help u develop cleaner code searching best path delivery citythe lowest level get world city property x horizontal location map vertical location map id city id corresponds city name basic property may create another one coord tuple x may chek city prime is_prime boolean indication prime let implement see work", "tags_descriptive": []}
