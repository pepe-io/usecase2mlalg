{"title": "CatBoost Classifier in Python", "description": "CatBoost Classifier in PythonHello friends, In our machine learning journey, all of us have to deal with categorical data at some point of time. In sklearn, we are required to convert these categories into the numerical format. In order to do this conversion, we use several pre-processing methods like \u201clabel encoding\u201d, \u201cone hot encoding\u201d and others. In this kernel, we will discuss an open sourced library - CatBoost developed and contributed by Yandex. CatBoost can use categorical features directly and is scalable in nature. So, let's get started.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/catboost-classifier-in-python", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "catboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-20 03:53:16", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:38:00", "words": 88, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.28032127022743225, "description_category_runtime": 9.121, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9782965183258057, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.034, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.28032127022743225, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9782965183258057, "runtime_cat": 23.155, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.755", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999962370715603", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "catboost classifier pythonhello friend machine learning journey u deal categorical data point time sklearn required convert category numerical format order conversion use several preprocessing method like label encoding one hot encoding others kernel discus open sourced library catboost developed contributed yandex catboost use categorical feature directly scalable nature let get started", "tags_descriptive": []}
