{"title": "Mathematical Solution to Sigmoid Parameters", "description": "To Sigmoid or not to Sigmoid, that is the QuestionA lot of people already noticed that the cumulative amount of cases for Hubei follows a sigmoid function. The general opinion however was that in a lot of countries/regions it is still too early to try and fit these sigmoids. In my notebook from last week I tried fitting them anyway, by making some 'educated' guesses about the expected maximum value and grow rate. Thanks to Sudeep Shouche I came across the paper by Milan Batista entitled \"Estimation of the final size of the coronavirus epidemic by the logistic model\". What is interesting here is that Batista is able to provide a mathematical solution to these parameters.
