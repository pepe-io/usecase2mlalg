{"title": "Yolov3 model with pretrained weights", "description": "The following is just a rough draft/incomplete solution to the problem. I don't know if I'll be able to complete on time or not becuase of University stuff. But here it is as of now. I put heavy emphasis on the preprocessing. A lot of the preprocessing is stuff I learnt from my college course \"Digital Image Processing\".
