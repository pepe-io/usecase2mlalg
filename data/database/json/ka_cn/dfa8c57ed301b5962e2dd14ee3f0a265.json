{"title": "Santander Customer Transaction - EDA", "description": "Our goalIn this competition we are asked to predict if a customer will make a transaction or not regardless of the amount of money transacted. Hence our goal is to solve a binary classification problem. In the data description you can see that the features given are numeric and anonymized. Furthermore the data seems to be artificial as they state that \"the data has the same structure as our real data\".
