{"title": "Molecular Properties EDA and models", "description": "General informationThis kernel is created using data of Predicting Molecular Properties competition. We have information about atom couples in molecules and need to predict scalar_coupling_constant between these atoms.  In this kernel I'll do EDA and will try some approaches to modelling. ~Thanks to the new kaggle update we can write code in kernels and import it. This is much more convenient and useful. I'm moving all the functions I can into this script: https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/artgor-utils So if you see somewhere code like artgot_utils.function_name(parameters) - it is from this script~ Important: It seems that after forking the utility script isn't copied, so I have decided to move all the functions back into the kernel. But utility kernel can't be removed from the kernel... I hope I was able to deal with it.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/molecular-properties-eda-and-models", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering", "Regression"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-07-18 06:29:46", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:53:35", "words": 131, "sentences": 8, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.7729175090789795, "description_category_runtime": 13.257, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.965751051902771, "description_subcategory_runtime": 21.023, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.7729175090789795, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.965751051902771, "runtime_cat": 34.28, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.803", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978007570539", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general informationthis kernel created using data predicting molecular property competition information atom couple molecule need predict scalar_coupling_constant atom kernel ill eda try approach modelling thanks new kaggle update write code kernel import much convenient useful im moving function script httpswwwkagglecomartgorartgorutils see somewhere code like artgot_utilsfunction_nameparameters script important seems forking utility script isnt copied decided move function back kernel utility kernel cant removed kernel hope able deal", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Feature Engineering", "Regression"]}
