{"title": "A simple nn solution with Keras (~0.48611 PL)", "description": "This was just an example how nn can solve this problems. Potencial improvements of the kernel: - Increase the embeddings factos - Decrease the batch size - Add Batch Normalization - Try LSTM, Bidirectional RNN, stack RNN - Try with more dense layers or more rnn outputs -  etc. Or even try a new architecture!   Any comment will be welcome.
