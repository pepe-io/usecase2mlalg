{"title": "PANDA: EDA, Visualizations & Suspicious Data", "description": "Quick OverviewIn this challenge, the objective is to detect and classify the severity of prostate cancer on images of prostate tissue samples. In practice, tissue samples are examined and scored by pathologists according to the so-called Gleason grading system which is later converted to an ISUP grade. But we will get into this in a bit. Let's have a quick look at the data and get an overview.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/iamleonie/panda-eda-visualizations-suspicious-data", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-04-28 13:54:43", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:03:25", "words": 68, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.5859026908874512, "description_category_runtime": 6.679, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.491657555103302, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.976, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.5859026908874512, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.491657555103302, "runtime_cat": 16.657, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.683", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999995318241268", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "quick overviewin challenge objective detect classify severity prostate cancer image prostate tissue sample practice tissue sample examined scored pathologist according socalled gleason grading system later converted isup grade get bit let quick look data get overview", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
