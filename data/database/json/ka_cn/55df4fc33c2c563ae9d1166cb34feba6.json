{"title": "Multi-Class Logistic Regression using Tensor Flow ", "description": "Thank you to inversion, whose code I have modified for importing BSON files. This kernel is to understand how one could structure their data to run it through Tensor Flow. I have only used the train_example.bson data and have not bothered to split the data into train/dev sets as there are only 82 images in this data. This produces very bad results but hopefully you will find it useful!
