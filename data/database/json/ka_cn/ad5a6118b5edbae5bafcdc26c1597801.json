{"title": "RSNA-STR [\ufe0f3D Stacking \ufe0f3D Plot \ufe0fSegmentation]", "description": "DICOM Processing and Segmentation in Python DICOM is a pain in the neck.  It also happens to be very helpful.  As clinical radiologists, we expect post-processing, even taking them for granted. However, the magic that occurs behind the scenes is no easy feat, so let\u2019s explore some of that magic. In this quest, we will be starting from raw DICOM images. We will extract voxel data from DICOM into numpy arrays, and then perform some low-level operations to normalize and resample the data, made possible using information in the DICOM headers. The remainder of the Quest is dedicated to visualizing the data in 1D (by histogram), 2D, and 3D. Finally, we will create segmentation masks that remove all voxel except for the lungs. Processing raw DICOM with Python is a little like excavating a dinosaur \u2013 you\u2019ll want to have a jackhammer to dig, but also a pickaxe and even a toothbrush for the right situations. Python has all the tools, from pre-packaged imaging process packages handling gigabytes of data at once to byte-level operations on a single voxel.
