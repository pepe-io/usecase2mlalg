{"title": "Keras flow_from_directory on Python", "description": "From the beginning, I decided to use Keras for the task. As for the start I googled \"keras images classification\" and found great blog post by Francois Chollet. (blog https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html github code https://gist.github.com/fchollet/7eb39b44eb9e16e59632d25fb3119975) The code in the blog has simple and understandable structure. Also, there are few posts in the competition Kernels where the similar approach was applied. Thus some addition insight is available. (Specifically, these two kernels helped me a lot: https://www.kaggle.com/ogurtsov/0-99-with-r-and-keras-inception-v3-fine-tune https://www.kaggle.com/fujisan/use-keras-pre-trained-vgg16-acc-98)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/ievgenvp/keras-flow-from-directory-on-python", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-08-09 20:48:18", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:11:50", "words": 74, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.191481351852417, "description_category_runtime": 15.172, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9495405554771423, "description_subcategory_runtime": 23.96, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.191481351852417, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9495405554771423, "runtime_cat": 39.133, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.782", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977224034204", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "beginning decided use kera task start googled kera image classification found great blog post francois chollet blog httpsblogkerasiobuildingpowerfulimageclassificationmodelsusingverylittledatahtml github code httpsgistgithubcomfchollet7eb39b44eb9e16e59632d25fb3119975 code blog simple understandable structure also post competition kernel similar approach applied thus addition insight available specifically two kernel helped lot httpswwwkagglecomogurtsov099withrandkerasinceptionv3finetune httpswwwkagglecomfujisanusekeraspretrainedvgg16acc98", "tags_descriptive": []}
