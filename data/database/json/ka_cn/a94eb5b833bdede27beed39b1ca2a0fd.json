{"title": "Sigmoid per country", "description": "STATISTICAL APPROACH FOR MAKING PREDICTIONS OF CONFIRMED INFECTION AND DEATHS ON CORONA VIRUSI will be reimplementing the model proposed by researchers from TU Eindhoven in this notebook. They proposed to fit a simple sigmoid function to each of the measurements of a country:  with M the maximal number of cases, \ud835\udefc the number of days at which the expected number of counts is half way the maximum,and \ud835\udefd > 0 the growth parameter. Special caution should be taken with exponential models such as these though... I am not saying that this is the ideal approach, I am merely replicating their study !!! IMPORTANT: The public test set overlaps with the training set !!! We have to filter out data from after 11/03 in order to get an accurate public LB score", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/group16/sigmoid-per-country-no-leakage", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-21 08:42:18", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:11:58", "words": 132, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Government and Public Works", "description_category_score": 0.043791186064481735, "description_category_runtime": 12.987, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.26553815603256226, "description_subcategory_runtime": 20.165, "category": "Government and Public Works", "category_score": 0.043791186064481735, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.26553815603256226, "runtime_cat": 33.151, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.708", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999955661709529", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "statistical approach making prediction confirmed infection death corona virusi reimplementing model proposed researcher tu eindhoven notebook proposed fit simple sigmoid function measurement country maximal number case number day expected number count half way maximumand 0 growth parameter special caution taken exponential model though saying ideal approach merely replicating study important public test set overlap training set filter data 1103 order get accurate public lb score", "tags_descriptive": []}
