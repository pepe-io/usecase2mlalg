{"title": "Some DICOM gotchas to be aware of (fastai)", "description": "Let's explore the data, taking advantage of the features of the fastai.medical.imaging library, available in the prerelease of fastai v2. If you're interested in learning more about fastai v2, check out the dedicated forum. For a deep dive, have a look at the 10 fastai v2 code walkthru videos. The overall approach in the library is described in detail (and many parts implememted from scratch) in the course Deep Learning from the Foundations. Since this is a prerelease, it's not installed on Kaggle yet, so we'll install it and import the necessary modules.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/some-dicom-gotchas-to-be-aware-of-fastai", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-18 07:58:26", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:47:30", "words": 93, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.34152549505233765, "description_category_runtime": 9.738, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6683910489082336, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.881, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.34152549505233765, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.6683910489082336, "runtime_cat": 24.619, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.767", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999960071989084", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "let explore data taking advantage feature fastaimedicalimaging library available prerelease fastai v2 youre interested learning fastai v2 check dedicated forum deep dive look 10 fastai v2 code walkthru video overall approach library described detail many part implememted scratch course deep learning foundation since prerelease installed kaggle yet well install import necessary module", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
