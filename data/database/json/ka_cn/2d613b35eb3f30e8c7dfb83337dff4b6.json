{"title": "Collaborative Filtering", "description": "Collaborative FilteringThis is a starter notebook forked from last year's competition. This is an implementation of Collaborative filtering starter with Keras. Uses only the win(1) and loss(0) label of each match and categorical encoding of team Ids as training data. Essentially the formula used is shown below: Model prediction = Dot product of the 2 teams in each match (embedding vectors)+ (Team1 bias) + (Team2 bias)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/dicksonchin93/collaborative-filtering", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-03-13 06:13:06", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:57:27", "words": 66, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.18249846994876862, "description_category_runtime": 7.404, "description_subcategory": "Insurance and Risk", "description_subcategory_score": 0.20952127873897552, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.497, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.18249846994876862, "subcategory": "Insurance and Risk", "subcategory_score": 0.20952127873897552, "runtime_cat": 18.901, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.689", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999956435058125", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "collaborative filteringthis starter notebook forked last year competition implementation collaborative filtering starter kera us win1 loss0 label match categorical encoding team id training data essentially formula used shown model prediction dot product 2 team match embedding vector team1 bias team2 bias", "tags_descriptive": []}
