{"title": "Simple Experiment View", "description": "Save RGB Images with PytorchMostly taken from Karl Heyer's script linked here This code saves RGB converted versions of all images in the train and test sets. The conversion is done using code from the RXRX1 Utils Repo adapted to Pytorch. Note that since this code saves images, it won't work on Kaggle read only kernels", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/darraghdog/simple-experiment-view", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-09-11 10:00:45", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:34:09", "words": 56, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.26230499148368835, "description_category_runtime": 6.255, "description_subcategory": "Transportation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9276587963104248, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.538, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.26230499148368835, "subcategory": "Transportation", "subcategory_score": 0.9276587963104248, "runtime_cat": 15.793, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.633", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999996128970835", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "save rgb image pytorchmostly taken karl heyers script linked code save rgb converted version image train test set conversion done using code rxrx1 utils repo adapted pytorch note since code save image wont work kaggle read kernel", "tags_descriptive": []}
