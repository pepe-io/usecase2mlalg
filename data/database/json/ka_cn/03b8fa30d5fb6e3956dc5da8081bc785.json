{"title": "Dog Breed - Pretrained keras models(LB 0.3) ", "description": "Transfer learning with pretrained Keras modelsAlthough Kernel resources were increased recently we still can not train useful CNNs without GPU. The original ImageNet set has quite a few different dog classes so we can reuse CNNs with pretrained ImageNet weights. Fortunately prediction is much faster (<1s/image) making it possible to run meaningful experiments with Kaggle Kernels.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/gaborfodor/dog-breed-pretrained-keras-models-lb-0-3", "tags": ["DL", "CNN", "CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-16 17:32:43", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:55:48", "words": 56, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Media & Publishing", "description_category_score": 0.1606544703245163, "description_category_runtime": 6.309, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9105027914047241, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.665, "category": "Media & Publishing", "category_score": 0.1606544703245163, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9105027914047241, "runtime_cat": 15.974, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.809", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965658159519", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "transfer learning pretrained kera modelsalthough kernel resource increased recently still train useful cnns without gpu original imagenet set quite different dog class reuse cnns pretrained imagenet weight fortunately prediction much faster 1simage making possible run meaningful experiment kaggle kernel", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
