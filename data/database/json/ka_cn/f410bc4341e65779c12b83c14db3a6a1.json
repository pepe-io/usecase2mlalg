{"title": "How To: Easy Visualization of Molecules.", "description": "HOW TO: Easy Visualization of Molecules.Greetings everyone! I've seen many people ask for a simple yet elegant visualization tool for the Predicting Molecular Properties challenge. Therefore, I'm going to explain in this Kernel how to install and use ase, which is a python module that allows one to work with atoms and molecules. It is available on gitlab: ase. The first thing we need to do is to install ase on our Kernel. To do that, just click on the Settings tab on the right panel, then click on Install..., right next to Packages. In the pip package name entry, just write ase then hit Install Package. Kaggle is going to do its things then restart the Kernel. ase should then be installed!
