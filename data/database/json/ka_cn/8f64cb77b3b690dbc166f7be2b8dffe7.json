{"title": "[Training] EfficientDet", "description": "Really good training pipeline for pytorch EfficientDetHi everyone! My name is Alex Shonenkov, I am DL/NLP/CV/TS research engineer. Especially I am in Love with NLP & DL. Recently I have created kernel for this competition about Weighted Boxes Fusion:  WBF approach for ensemble  I hope it is useful for you, my friends! If you didn't read this kernel, don't forget to do it! :) Today I would like to share really good training pipeline for this competition using SOTA EfficientDet: Scalable and Efficient Object Detection", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/training-efficientdet", "tags": ["DL", "CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch", "albumentations"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-26 20:24:50", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:14:55", "words": 87, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.20584966242313385, "description_category_runtime": 9.074, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6399161219596863, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.987, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.20584966242313385, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6399161219596863, "runtime_cat": 23.06, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.801", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999957070103347", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "really good training pipeline pytorch efficientdethi everyone name alex shonenkov dlnlpcvts research engineer especially love nlp dl recently created kernel competition weighted box fusion wbf approach ensemble hope useful friend didnt read kernel dont forget today would like share really good training pipeline competition using sota efficientdet scalable efficient object detection", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
