{"title": "cifar10 with CNN for beginer", "description": "An experimentation of computer vision challenge for beginer(75% val_accuracy in 25 epochs, and 79% after 50 epochs without data augmentation).The codes of this notebook are taken on keras documentation. I am just crying to give some explaination for that code. I hope that this migth be helpful for you.
