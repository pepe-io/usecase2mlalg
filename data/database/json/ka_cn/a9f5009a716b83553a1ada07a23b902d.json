{"title": "Mercari Data Analysis", "description": "IntroductionThis Python notebook seeks to explore Mercari's data set, in order to extract \"what to do\" and \"what not to do\". The main idea is to contribute to the community with quick, but deep, first view of the data. It contains some visualizations and data manipulation, that can be further used to build your own Machine Learning Models. Feel free to contribute to this Kernel with your thoughts. Happy Kaggling!", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/huguera/mercari-data-analysis", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-05-27 03:11:39", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:05:42", "words": 70, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.26658886671066284, "description_category_runtime": 7.076, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5780176520347595, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.973, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.26658886671066284, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5780176520347595, "runtime_cat": 18.049, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.743", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984367230919", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionthis python notebook seek explore mercaris data set order extract main idea contribute community quick deep first view data contains visualization data manipulation used build machine learning model feel free contribute kernel thought happy kaggling", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
