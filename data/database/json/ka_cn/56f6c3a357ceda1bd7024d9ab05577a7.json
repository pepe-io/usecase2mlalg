{"title": "DS4G: An analytical approach to NO2 emissions", "description": "(ignore this \u2934 warning about deleted datasets!) An Analytical Approach to NO2 EmissionsTL;DR: I take an analytical approach, measuring a line density of NO2 on windy days at each point and fitting a distribution function to this line. This function gives the emissions in kg/hr. I use night time lights satellite imagery as a proxy for human activity to separate power and non-power emissions and then use the generation at each site with this value to calculate an emissions factor in kg/MWh. OverviewWe need to calculate the emissions factor in kg/MWh (or some equivalent) averaged for one year of Puerto Rico's energy production. Bonus points if we can calculate sub-annual and marginal emissions factors. So we need to figure out the following system:  Puerto Rico's wind blows mainly from the east, so there won't be any pollution blown in. But the rest still need to be accounted for. This problem definitely seems to want an analytical approach (rather than statistics/machine learning) so I'm going to go with that (and check if it makes sense along the way). In addition, I'm going to keep the data sources as simple as possible! There are several places where I could improve the accuracy by including more data from Google Earth Engine and other sources, but as this is a demonstration of a method, I'm going to keep it simple. For example, as I'm going to focus on the troposphere as a whole, I should probably use several wind fields that apply to the whole troposphere, instead of just the GFS data near the ground. Emissions factorSimplifying from the EPA formula: EF = E / G where:  EF: emissions factor (kg/MWh) E: emissions (kg/hr) G: generation (MWh/hr)  So if I can determine the emissions that are attributable to electricity generation, and if I know the generation, then I can calculate the emissions factor! Quick explanation that may be useful: a plant's capacity, usually measured in MW (megawatts) is the maximum instantaneous power it can output, while it's generation, often in MWh (megawatt-hours) is the amount of energy actually produced in a given time period. If the plant runs at full capacity non-stop (i.e. capacity factor equals 100%) then the generation will be a simple multiple of capacity. Normally, however, plants produce much less, and have a capacity factor below 100%. It might be 30% for wind and solar, 50-60% for fossil fuels, and 80%+ for nuclear power.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/chrisarderne/ds4g-an-analytical-approach-to-no2-emissions", "tags": ["Geospatial Analysis", "Pollution"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-25 12:57:20", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 19:11:13", "words": 406, "sentences": 15, "sum_nltk": "I use night time lights satellite imagery as a proxy for human activity to separate power and non-power emissions and then use the generation at each site with this value to calculate an emissions factor in kg/MWh.
