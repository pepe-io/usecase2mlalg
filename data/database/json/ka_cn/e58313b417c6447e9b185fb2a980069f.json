{"title": "3 Basic Classifiers and Features Correlation", "description": "IntroHello! This is a short guide on how to set up basic classifiers for the \"Leaf Classification\" dataset. I'm still a novice in the field, I've been poking around Kaggle for a while now, so this is more of a notebook for myself, to keep track of what I am learning, than an actual guide. Suggestions and comments are more than welcome! I will use three of the simplest classification methods (Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest and Logistic Regression) and, given the high number of features in this dataset, I will briefly comment on how to reduce their correlation with Principal Component Analysis.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/asparago/3-basic-classifiers-and-features-correlation", "tags": ["Random Forest", "Classification", "Naive Bayes", "Logistic Regression"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-04-13 18:57:32", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:03:36", "words": 102, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.013036794029176235, "description_category_runtime": 9.559, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6987758874893188, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.831, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.013036794029176235, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6987758874893188, "runtime_cat": 24.391, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.754", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999954855987406", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introhello short guide set basic classifier leaf classification dataset im still novice field ive poking around kaggle notebook keep track learning actual guide suggestion comment welcome use three simplest classification method naive bayes random forest logistic regression given high number feature dataset briefly comment reduce correlation principal component analysis", "tags_descriptive": ["Random Forest", "Classification", "Naive Bayes", "Logistic Regression"]}
