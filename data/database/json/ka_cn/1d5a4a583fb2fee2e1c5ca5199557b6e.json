It is targeted at beginners. Running it you will be able to  take a look at the data for the challenge and its features train a basic convolutional neural network on all of the data (many of the other kernels only train on parts of the data) create your first submission ( LB ~0.93)  Contents Useful python modules The challenge and the data Loading the data EDA Creating a simple keras model Training and validating the model Creating a submission", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/gomezp/complete-beginner-s-guide-eda-keras-lb-0-93", "tags": ["Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-01-23 21:19:07", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:43:30", "words": 125, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.16347752511501312, "description_category_runtime": 17.618, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5277500152587891, "description_subcategory_runtime": 28.618, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.16347752511501312, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5277500152587891, "runtime_cat": 46.236, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.72", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999950679054409", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "acknowledgementsthis kernel contains excerpt inspired following kernel httpswwwkagglecomqitvisionacompletemlpipelinefastai httpswwwkagglecomcvxtzcnnstarternasnetmobile09709lb httpswwwkagglecomfmarazzibaselinekerascnnrocfast10min0925lb httpswwwkagglecomartgorsimpleedaandmodelinpytorch introductionthis kernel exemplary presentation simple exploratory data analysis eda tutorial creating first model challenge targeted beginner running able take look data challenge feature train basic convolutional neural network data many kernel train part data create first submission lb 093 content useful python module challenge data loading data eda creating simple kera model training validating model creating submission", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification"]}
