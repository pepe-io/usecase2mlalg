The only thing we need to know is which character for each difficulty corresponds to the plaintext space character. The most frequent character for each of difficulty 1, 2 and 3 is easily found and used as space.  \"1\" is space for difficulty 1 and \"8\" is space for difficulty 2 and 3.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kaggleuser58/1-char-decryption-in-level-1-2-and-3-gives-98-85", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-01-09 22:08:28", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:01:56", "words": 69, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.14764796197414398, "description_category_runtime": 6.986, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.36779463291168213, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.778, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.14764796197414398, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.36779463291168213, "runtime_cat": 17.765, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.591", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999996231150332", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel show get 9885 ciphertexts matched plaintext without decryption thing need know character difficulty corresponds plaintext space character frequent character difficulty 1 2 3 easily found used space 1 space difficulty 1 8 space difficulty 2 3", "tags_descriptive": []}
