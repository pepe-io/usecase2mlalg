{"title": "Pulmonary Fibrosis Competition: EDA & DICOM Prep", "description": "OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Competition EDA and Preprocessing1. Introduction#1. Why do we do this?Pulmonary = lung | fibrosis = scar tissue => Scarring in the lungs. Over time, scarring can destroy the normal lung and make it hard for oxygen to get into your blood. Pulmonary fibrosis isn\u2019t just one disease. It is a family of more than 200 different lung diseases that all look very much alike.   #2. EvaluationLaplace Log Likelihood (modified version): useful to evaluate a model's confidence in its decisions. The error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set Patient_Weeks (three per patient). Note that metric values will be negative and higher is better. #3. Code CompetitionCode Competitions seem more fair to me. Keep in mind:  CPU runtime <= 9 hrs GPU runtime <= 4 hrs NO internet access (for inference, but can be used during training) Submission file name: submission.csv  #4. Competition aim:Predict how severe is going to decline the lung capacity in the lungs based on a CT (Computerised Tomography) scan + metadata of the patient. CTs can show soft tissues, blood vessels, and bones much more detailed than normal X-rays.  Lung Function: assessed based on a spirometer output which measures the FVC (forced vital capacity), meaning how much air is exhaled.
