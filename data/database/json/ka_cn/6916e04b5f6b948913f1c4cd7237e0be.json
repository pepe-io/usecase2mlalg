{"title": "Is this Malware? [EDA, FE and lgb][updated]", "description": "Microsoft Malware PredictionThe goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machine\u2019s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. It is really important to find out whether the computer is infected and cure it. We have a huge dataset of data, where most features are categorical. I think that correct mean encoding should be important. Also the number of columns is quite high so it could be tempting to make some automatical processing for all columns. I personally think that it is important to analyze each variable and it could help to do a better processing. In this kernel I'll do a detailed EDA, feature engineering and modelling.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/is-this-malware-eda-fe-and-lgb-updated", "tags": ["Classification", "Feature Engineering", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Gradient Boosting"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "catboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-02-25 17:37:23", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:13:18", "words": 118, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.05125129222869873, "description_category_runtime": 10.039, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.21647417545318604, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.606, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.05125129222869873, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.21647417545318604, "runtime_cat": 25.646, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.785", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975677003305", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "microsoft malware predictionthe goal competition predict window machine probability getting infected various family malware based different property machine really important find whether computer infected cure huge dataset data feature categorical think correct mean encoding important also number column quite high could tempting make automatical processing column personally think important analyze variable could help better processing kernel ill detailed eda feature engineering modelling", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Feature Engineering", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Gradient Boosting"]}
