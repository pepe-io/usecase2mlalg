{"title": "Keras U-Net starter - LB 0.277", "description": "IntroHello! This rather quick and dirty kernel shows how to get started on segmenting nuclei using a neural network in Keras. The architecture used is the so-called U-Net, which is very common for image segmentation problems such as this. I believe they also have a tendency to work quite well even on small datasets. Let's get started importing everything we need!", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/keegil/keras-u-net-starter-lb-0-277", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "skimage", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-01-18 12:47:50", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:38:53", "words": 61, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.11459656804800034, "description_category_runtime": 6.54, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.963882565498352, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.004, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.11459656804800034, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.963882565498352, "runtime_cat": 16.543, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.846", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967595800052", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introhello rather quick dirty kernel show get started segmenting nucleus using neural network kera architecture used socalled unet common image segmentation problem believe also tendency work quite well even small datasets let get started importing everything need", "tags_descriptive": []}
