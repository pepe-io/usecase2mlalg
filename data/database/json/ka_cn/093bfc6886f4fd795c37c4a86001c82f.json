{"title": "CatBoost Baseline with Feature Importance", "description": "Catboost is known as a convenient and effective tool for handling categorical features. Let's build a Catboost baseline by specifying the categorical feature indices to the model. I have also tried some cyclical and ordinal encoding methods. This is my first try on Catboost. If you have found any mistake, please write your comments below. Thank you very much. This notebook is modified from Why Not Logistic Regression?.
