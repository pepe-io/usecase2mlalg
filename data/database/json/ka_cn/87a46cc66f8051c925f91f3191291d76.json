{"title": "Covid-19 Cytokine Storm", "description": "COVID-19 and the Cytokine Storm: The Crucial Role of IL-6Emerging data suggest that many patients infected with COVID-19 may die due to an excessive response of their immune system, characterized by the abnormal release of circulating cytokines, termed cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS plays a major role in the deterioration of COVID-19 patients, from pneumonia through acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cumulating in systemic inflammation and ultimately multi-system organ failure. This phenomenon of a plethora of cytokines wreaking havoc throughout the body is often vividly referred to as \u201ccytokine storm.\u201d https://www.enzolifesciences.com/science-center/technotes/2020/april/covid-19-and-the-cytokine-storm-the-crucial-role-of-il-6/", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mpwolke/covid-19-cytokine-storm", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["caffe", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-28 01:17:01", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:51:06", "words": 91, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.5381870865821838, "description_category_runtime": 13.466, "description_subcategory": "Failure", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4761416018009186, "description_subcategory_runtime": 20.876, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.5381870865821838, "subcategory": "Failure", "subcategory_score": 0.4761416018009186, "runtime_cat": 34.344, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.542", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978179494413", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "covid19 cytokine storm crucial role il6emerging data suggest many patient infected covid19 may die due excessive response immune system characterized abnormal release circulating cytokine termed cytokine release syndrome cr cr play major role deterioration covid19 patient pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards cumulating systemic inflammation ultimately multisystem organ failure phenomenon plethora cytokine wreaking havoc throughout body often vividly referred cytokine storm httpswwwenzolifesciencescomsciencecentertechnotes2020aprilcovid19andthecytokinestormthecrucialroleofil6", "tags_descriptive": []}
