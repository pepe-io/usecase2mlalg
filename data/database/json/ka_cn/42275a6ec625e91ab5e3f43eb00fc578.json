{"title": "Landmark-Recognition-Multiprocessing | Image-Size", "description": "Fast Image Reading via Multiprocessing & Getting Image SizesThe train dataset contains ~1.5 million images. The popular image libraries, such as imageio or cv2, read ~20 images in a second on average (the average is based on first 38k images in the train dataset). Reading 1.5 million images with this average rate would give a total reading time of 20.8 hr, which is impossibly long to keep the kaggle notebebook alive. This reading time can be reduced by multiprocessing as can be shown in this notebook. Exploiting this faster reading time, I present here a full list of image size (xsize, ysize) and depth (channel) information for all train images. P.S. Please don't forget to upvote, if you find the notebook useful.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tolgadincer/landmark-recognition-multiprocessing-image-size", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-02 22:19:35", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:43:16", "words": 122, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.42342817783355713, "description_category_runtime": 12.503, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5378344058990479, "description_subcategory_runtime": 19.475, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.42342817783355713, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.5378344058990479, "runtime_cat": 31.978, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.641", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999983331952248", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "fast image reading via multiprocessing getting image sizesthe train dataset contains 15 million image popular image library imageio cv2 read 20 image second average average based first 38k image train dataset reading 15 million image average rate would give total reading time 208 hr impossibly long keep kaggle notebebook alive reading time reduced multiprocessing shown notebook exploiting faster reading time present full list image size xsize ysize depth channel information train image p please dont forget upvote find notebook useful", "tags_descriptive": []}
