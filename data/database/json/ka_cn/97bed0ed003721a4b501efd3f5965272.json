OverviewThe City of Los Angeles faces a big hiring challenge - 1/3 of its 50,000 workers are eligible to retire by July of 2020. This is an issue of big concern. As mentioned by one of the competition hosts, there are some job classes that will be challenging to fill with qualified candidates fullfilling the vision of City of LA. Their vision is to maintain excellence, provide consistent services to customers, and to meet the challenges of tomorrow through expertise, innovation, and cooperative partnerships. To acheive this, they aim to fill the vacancies with quality resources maintaining diversity. We tried to parse the data for job bulletins and tried to simplify and highlight things to realise good and bad points to overcome this challenge. Here are few points we tried to focus on in the successive sections:  To get insights from the text. To identify implicit bias in text that might be putting off people of specific gender, age, race from applying to a job class. To achieve high quality and quantity of applications. To identify and simplify the process of promotional paths.   1.1 Related Existing Systems at City of LAJob Match The functionality is available at LA city web portal. Users can select multiple fields of their interest, education/training and experience, based on which jobs are searched and displayed. Job Analysis Below is an excerpt from LA city web portal. Job analysis is the systematic identification and documentation of the tasks performed on the job and the competencies required to perform the tasks based on information/data provided by a representative group of job experts.  Information in the job analysis must be sufficiently descriptive and detailed to provide an understanding of the job.  Job is a class in the City of Los Angeles Classification Plan. Tasks are discrete, self-contained units of work. They reflect the specific behavior of individuals when performing the work. Competencies are the knowledge, skill, ability, aptitude, capability, or other personal characteristics needed to perform the job. Representative group refers to a sufficiently large sample that proportionally reflects the class. Job experts are individuals with in-depth knowledge of the job and its requirements.  City of Los Angeles Personnel Department staff conducts job analyses by interviewing job experts, usually job incumbents and/or supervisors, and having them complete questionnaires. A formal observation of the job may also be conducted as part of the job analysis. Job Awareness From AMA discussion section:  Social media promotions Word of mouth, general interest in government. Job bulletins are available on current job openings web page.   1.2 Problem StatementKaggle describes it as: For filling vacancies several job ads are posted which plays one of the vital role to attract job applications. The content, tone, and format of job bulletins can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly-specific job requirements may discourage diversity. The Los Angeles Mayor\u2019s Office wants to reimagine the city\u2019s job bulletins by using text analysis to identify needed improvements. The goal is to convert a folder full of plain-text job postings into a single structured CSV file and then to use this data to:  identify language that can negatively bias the pool of applicants; improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool; make it easier to determine which promotions are available to employees in each job class.  Data Description The job bulletins are provided as a folder of plain-text files, one for each job classification. Job Bulletins Folder  683 plain-text job postings  Instructions and Additional Documents Folder  Job Bulletins with Annotations Annotation Descriptions.docx City Job Paths PDFs Description of promotions in job bulletins.docx Job_titles.csv Kaggle_data_dictionary.csv Sample job class export template.csv   1.3 ChallengesDealing with unstructured data is a real challenge yet the most important task. The plain text/data have a low degree of organization and is thus bit difficult to scan. It is on top priority to make this kind of data easily scannable to make it into a good use. Here as well, the Job bulletins have data which is in unstructured format. It has internal structure but is not structured via pre-defined data models or schema which makes it difficult to parse. Extracting information from text files, converting unstructured information into a structured format, combining the data, and ensuring data quality are a few roadblocks faced when it comes to making sense of the data.  To get head around nondescript data and use it to validate assumptions and support decision-making ability, as well as integrate it with visualization tools is a challenge which needs to be overcome.  Finding an ideal data extraction solution required some time and effort, but it allows to consolidate structured and unstructured data and give it a clear purpose for a more effective solution.  1.4 Possible Solution Highlights1. Be where your candidates are!  Professional Job Platforms (LinkedIn) \u2003City of LA web portal doesn't have link to the most used professionals' network portal. Social networking sites \u2003Whether that\u2019s Snapchat, Reddit, or LinkedIn. Use social media platform which helps to logon to most popular websites and reach large audience. Mobile App \u2003According to Indeed, 65% of job seekers use their mobile devices to look for jobs. The ability to apply on mobile is especially important for hourly workers who might not have access to a desktop computer.  2. Deal with bias  Proactive measures \u2003Understanding the hiring bias and how it works and by being actively alert to it creeping into your hiring process, you can nip it in the bud. Evaluate \u2003Shortlist!! - Names, pictures and even post codes can influence the hiring decision. Ideally, candidates are judged on their qualifications and skills, not geography or the characteristics of their particular demographic. A blind resume review helps eliminate a number of unconscious biases from the process, while also help to avoid overcompensating for the same biases. \u2003Put an everyday problem to your candidates, and assess whether their solution aligns with your organisation\u2019s values or ways of getting things done. This keeps everything professional, and avoids a number of common biases, such as age, gender, personality or appearance. \u2003Trainings to mitigate biases and increase cultural competency  3. Diversity Initiatives  For Female Employees \u2003Show a viable path forward. Introduce them with females at senior levels or visible role models. \u2003Improve and showcase work life balance. \u2003Improve and showcase childcare and parental leaves. For General Diversity \u2003Standardize the interview process. In order to get to the interview stage, you need to have an open minded diverse team of interviewee to ensure you\u2019re not putting off great candidates. \u2003Morever most people like everything straight. Indeed found 42% of job seekers found lengthy applications the most frustrating part of the application process. Try to cut-out on unwanted information. Keep it short: If possible, reduce candidate friction by creating a 1-click application process. If that doesn\u2019t work for you, keep your qualification questions to a minimum (e.g., five and less) \u2003The job description is often the first insight candidates have into your organisation\u2019s culture. Be as neutral as possible, and be aware of the message that certain language sends. \u2003You don\u2019t have to write a completely bland job description devoid of any adjectives. However, if you seek to strike a balance, you may see changes in your pool of candidates.    2. What's in the KernelData Conversion Exploratory Data Analysis Recommendations Applications     3.
