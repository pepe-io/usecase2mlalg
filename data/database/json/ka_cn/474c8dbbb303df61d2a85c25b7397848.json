{"title": "ML-Ensemble: Scikit-learn style ensemble learning ", "description": "The following notebook introduces ML-Ensemble, a Python library for memory-efficient parallel ensemble learning with a Scikit-learn API. ML-Ensemble also deploys a neural network-like API for building ensembles of several layers, and can accomodate a great variety of ensemble architectures. For more information, see ml-ensemble.com or visit the github repository.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/flennerhag/ml-ensemble-scikit-learn-style-ensemble-learning", "tags": ["Ensembling"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-01-23 11:06:57", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:50:10", "words": 49, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Manufacturing", "description_category_score": 0.22770942747592926, "description_category_runtime": 6.406, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9783231019973755, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.777, "category": "Manufacturing", "category_score": 0.22770942747592926, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9783231019973755, "runtime_cat": 16.184, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.775", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968597617157", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "following notebook introduces mlensemble python library memoryefficient parallel ensemble learning scikitlearn api mlensemble also deploys neural networklike api building ensemble several layer accomodate great variety ensemble architecture information see mlensemblecom visit github repository", "tags_descriptive": ["Ensembling"]}
