{"title": "Ensembling and Stacking with heamy", "description": "Forest Cover -Ensembling and Stacking with heamyIntroduction@author: Justfor - on Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/justfor This kernel shows Ensemble and Stacking  and has the the intention to show the use of the heamy package and to get a very high Leaderboard score. There are various packages for stacking available, but the heamy package has one great advantage: Caching ! This means your Classifier learns once and is then stored. When you need it again with the same date it is simply fetched. A great time-saver. heamy  is available from rushter's (Artem Golubin) github page:  https://github.com/rushter/heamy Furthermore I got Inspiration from the great kernels  Based on: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter (c) Faron (www.kaggle.com/mmueller) Work frum rushter https://www.kaggle.com/rushter/stacking-using-heamy  Ideas for Feature engineering from  TheGruffelo (https://www.kaggle.com/cbryant) in the  Notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/cbryant/new-features-and-recursive-feature-extraction) and  from schlerp (https://www.kaggle.com/schlerp) in the Notebook https://www.kaggle.com/schlerp/lgb-cv-ensemble-normalisation-fe", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/justfor/ensembling-and-stacking-with-heamy", "tags": ["Ensembling", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-09-19 21:45:55", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 19:58:02", "words": 138, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.1495933085680008, "description_category_runtime": 23.795, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8627731204032898, "description_subcategory_runtime": 38.162, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.1495933085680008, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8627731204032898, "runtime_cat": 61.957, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.709", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999964224759189", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "forest cover ensembling stacking heamyintroductionauthor justfor kaggle httpswwwkagglecomjustfor kernel show ensemble stacking intention show use heamy package get high leaderboard score various package stacking available heamy package one great advantage caching mean classifier learns stored need date simply fetched great timesaver heamy available rushters artem golubin github page httpsgithubcomrushterheamy furthermore got inspiration great kernel based httpswwwkagglecommmuellerallstateclaimsseveritystackingstarter c faron wwwkagglecommmueller work frum rushter httpswwwkagglecomrushterstackingusingheamy idea feature engineering thegruffelo httpswwwkagglecomcbryant notebook httpswwwkagglecomcbryantnewfeaturesandrecursivefeatureextraction schlerp httpswwwkagglecomschlerp notebook httpswwwkagglecomschlerplgbcvensemblenormalisationfe", "tags_descriptive": ["Ensembling", "Classification"]}
