{"title": "FaceForensics++ Baseline (dlib & no internet)", "description": "Running FaceForensics++ in a Kaggle Notebook In this notebook I test out the state of the art FaceForensics++ package on the provided dataset. Later in this notebook I modify the code slightly to predict for our dataset. This notebook imports from a dataset for:  dlib package wheel (needs to be installed for code to work) other required packages not in the default kernel pretrained models by FaceForensics++  The paper that was published can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08971.pdf  The github repo is here: https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics  Reference: @inproceedings{roessler2019faceforensicspp,     author = {Andreas R\\\"ossler and Davide Cozzolino and Luisa Verdoliva and Christian Riess and Justus Thies and Matthias Nie{\\ss}ner},     title = {Face{F}orensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images},     booktitle= {International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)},     year = {2019} }", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/faceforensics-baseline-dlib-no-internet", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch", "spacy", "Pillow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-12-30 04:49:02", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:44:56", "words": 144, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.23388132452964783, "description_category_runtime": 17.066, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9399423003196716, "description_subcategory_runtime": 27.413, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.23388132452964783, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9399423003196716, "runtime_cat": 44.48, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.762", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999952671713441", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "running faceforensics kaggle notebook notebook test state art faceforensics package provided dataset later notebook modify code slightly predict dataset notebook import dataset dlib package wheel need installed code work required package default kernel pretrained model faceforensics paper published found httpsarxivorgpdf190108971pdf github repo httpsgithubcomondyarifaceforensics reference inproceedingsroessler2019faceforensicspp author andreas rossler davide cozzolino luisa verdoliva christian riess justus thies matthias niessner title faceforensics learning detect manipulated facial image booktitle international conference computer vision iccv year 2019", "tags_descriptive": []}
