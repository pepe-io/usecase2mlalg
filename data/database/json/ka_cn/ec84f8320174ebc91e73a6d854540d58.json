{"title": "Kuzushiji Page Generator", "description": "Kuzushiji Page GeneratorThis notebook introduces a new way to automatically generate pages filled with Kuzushiji symbols using the great KMNIST dataset. The aim is to help pretraining models learning both character detection and classification at the same time before moving to the pages from the original competition dataset. Of course, the resulting pages would not make any sense!I have generated 20,000 pages using this script and made them available in the following dataset.If you find this notebook useful, please feel free to give it an upvote!", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/frlemarchand/kuzushiji-page-generator", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-09-25 22:50:53", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:36:30", "words": 86, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.01, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.1302725374698639, "description_category_runtime": 8.43, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5826408863067627, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.655, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.1302725374698639, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5826408863067627, "runtime_cat": 21.085, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.597", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999957899767047", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kuzushiji page generatorthis notebook introduces new way automatically generate page filled kuzushiji symbol using great kmnist dataset aim help pretraining model learning character detection classification time moving page original competition dataset course resulting page would make sensei generated 20000 page using script made available following datasetif find notebook useful please feel free give upvote", "tags_descriptive": []}
