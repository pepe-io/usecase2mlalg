{"title": "Bike Sharing Demand: EDA + Regression", "description": "I am super excited to share my first kernel with the Kaggle community. This kernel is for all the aspiring data scientists who wants to learn and review their knowledge. As I go on in this journey and learn new topics, I will incorporate them with each new updates. Going back to the topics of this kernel, I will do visualizations to explain the data, and machine learning algorithms to forecast bike rental demand  in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/hanifansari93/bike-sharing-demand-eda-modeling", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-07 20:49:39", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:15:12", "words": 83, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "description_category_score": 0.049587104469537735, "description_category_runtime": 7.653, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.958807110786438, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.15, "category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "category_score": 0.049587104469537735, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.958807110786438, "runtime_cat": 19.803, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.673", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999973034708509", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "super excited share first kernel kaggle community kernel aspiring data scientist want learn review knowledge go journey learn new topic incorporate new update going back topic kernel visualization explain data machine learning algorithm forecast bike rental demand capital bikeshare program washington dc", "tags_descriptive": []}
