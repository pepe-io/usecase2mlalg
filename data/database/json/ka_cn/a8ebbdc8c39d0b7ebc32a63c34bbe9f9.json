{"title": "Explain Red Hat Data and XGB Model", "description": "I want to illustrate my approach to Red Hat Competition. I have organized this notebook in four step:  Preprocessing and data exploration Building models Assessment Scoring  Red Hat give us a lot of crypted information to catch the behavior of their customer. The goal of the challenge is to classify in the better way the customers: every activities of users have an outcome good (=1) or bad (=0). My target is to set up the best model but also find the variables that major influence the outcome of a peolple, so I decice to not use the date/group leak. Some considerations (derived from logit models)  Customer with people_char_2 = type 2 have an attitude 8 times superior to give a good outcome than customer with people_char_2 = type 1 People with people_char_7 = type 1 have an attitude 26 time superior to give a good outcome with people_char_7 = type 15 Customer with people_char_6 = type 5 have an attitude 2.5 times superior to give a good outcome than customer with people_char_6 = type 1 People with week day of date attribute on monday have an attidute 9 superior to give a good outcome than customer registrated on saturday. glm_m <- glm(outcome ~   people_class_38 + people_char_2 + people_char_7 +   people_char_6   + people_day_of_week + people_class_1 +    people_char_5   + people_char_8 + char_1 + char_2 +    char_5 + group_10 + activity_category, data = d1,family = binomial())   The covariates for the model are: people_char_2, people_char_7, people_char_6, people_day_week, people_class_1, people_class_38, people_char_5, people_char_8, char_1, char_2, char_5, group_10, activity_category.
