{"title": "Feature Dynamics: looking at id groups", "description": "As shown before, some features per id can be clustered intro groups that perform the same kind of time evolution.  Unfortunately a unique feature does not perform the same dynamics for different ids. But maybe there are groups of ids that have identical or similar features and perhaps this groups can give some insights into the \"global\" dynamics. Assumptions: NaN values make sense. An id that has always NaNs for a specific feature has no relationship with it.   Id's live in different time-zones (and have different lifetimes)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/allunia/feature-dynamics-looking-at-id-groups", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-12-30 16:45:38", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:01:01", "words": 90, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.03617970272898674, "description_category_runtime": 8.557, "description_subcategory": "Judicial Applied", "description_subcategory_score": 0.16357465088367462, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.021, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.03617970272898674, "subcategory": "Judicial Applied", "subcategory_score": 0.16357465088367462, "runtime_cat": 21.578, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.723", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999996607276189", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "shown feature per id clustered intro group perform kind time evolution unfortunately unique feature perform dynamic different id maybe group id identical similar feature perhaps group give insight global dynamic assumption nan value make sense id always nan specific feature relationship id live different timezones different lifetime", "tags_descriptive": []}
