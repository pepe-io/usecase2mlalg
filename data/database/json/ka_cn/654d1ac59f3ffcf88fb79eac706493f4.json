{"title": "Keras MaskRCNN - Kuzushiji Recognition", "description": "Kuzushiji recognition with MaskRCNN using Keras/TensorflowThis kernel is here to establish the pipeline to use a MaskRCNN on the Kuzushiji competition dataset, even though there is little chance it can obtain great results in the processing time allowed on kernels. It is using the Matterplot implementation of MaskRCNN and is inspired from this kernel from the iMaterialist competition. One of the key steps that is introduced in this kernel is the data preparation which consists of generating masks using an Otsu threshold.If you find this kernel useful, please give an upvote! :)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/frlemarchand/keras-maskrcnn-kuzushiji-recognition", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-08-20 11:51:22", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:36:30", "words": 92, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.011733578518033028, "description_category_runtime": 9.262, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9856148362159729, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.143, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.011733578518033028, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9856148362159729, "runtime_cat": 23.406, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.721", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999963243343404", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kuzushiji recognition maskrcnn using kerastensorflowthis kernel establish pipeline use maskrcnn kuzushiji competition dataset even though little chance obtain great result processing time allowed kernel using matterplot implementation maskrcnn inspired kernel imaterialist competition one key step introduced kernel data preparation consists generating mask using otsu thresholdif find kernel useful please give upvote", "tags_descriptive": []}
