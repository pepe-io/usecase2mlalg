{"title": "Modified Naive Bayes - Santander - [0.899]", "description": "Modified Naive Bayes scores 0.899 LB - SantanderIn this kernel we demonstrate that unconstrained Naive Bayes can score 0.899 LB. I call it \"unconstrained\" because it doesn't assume that each variable has a Gaussian distribution like typical Naive Bayes. Instead we allow for arbitrary distributions and we plot these distributions below. I called it \"modified\" because we don't reverse the conditional probabilities. This kernel is useful because (1) it shows that an accurate score can be achieved using a simple model that assumes the variables are independent. And (2) this kernel displays interesting EDA which provides insights about the data.
