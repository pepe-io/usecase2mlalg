{"title": "Exploring the human protein atlas images", "description": "Exploratory data analysis of the human protein atlas image datasetupdate 5/10/2018: beginning of cell segmentation algorithm update 5/10/2018: add red + blue channels stack and whole cell identification (does not give a clean result, though) This kernel is just the beginning of a work in progress and will be updated very often. We will explore the dataset available for the human protein atlas image competition. Questions we would like to answer include:  what channels of the image contain the relevant information how much can we reduce dimensionality of data while retaining important information", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jschnab/exploring-the-human-protein-atlas-images", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-10-10 14:53:24", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 21:26:50", "words": 94, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.39317360520362854, "description_category_runtime": 8.905, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6595009565353394, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.604, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.39317360520362854, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6595009565353394, "runtime_cat": 22.51, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.748", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999966671513181", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "exploratory data analysis human protein atlas image datasetupdate 5102018 beginning cell segmentation algorithm update 5102018 add red blue channel stack whole cell identification give clean result though kernel beginning work progress updated often explore dataset available human protein atlas image competition question would like answer include channel image contain relevant information much reduce dimensionality data retaining important information", "tags_descriptive": []}
