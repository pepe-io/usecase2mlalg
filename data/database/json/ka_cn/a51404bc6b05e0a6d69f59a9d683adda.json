{"title": "Hungarian algorithm to optimize sirna prediction", "description": "Because we know that each plate contains 277 distinct classes, we can boost our predictions by solving the Assignment Problem. This approach can also be combined with predicting which group a plate belongs to (see https://www.kaggle.com/zaharch/keras-model-boosted-with-plates-leak), to narrow the 1108 classes to exactly 277. However, this is left out for simplicity. Uses the Hungarian algorithm to boost results from https://www.kaggle.com/chandyalex/recursion-cellular-keras-densenet (which scores 0.113), and acheives a + 0.016 boost over the baseline.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/christopherberner/hungarian-algorithm-to-optimize-sirna-prediction", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-09-07 19:53:36", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:34:09", "words": 72, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.09552452713251114, "description_category_runtime": 10.459, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5382972955703735, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.976, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.09552452713251114, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5382972955703735, "runtime_cat": 26.435, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.64", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999950340937083", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "know plate contains 277 distinct class boost prediction solving assignment problem approach also combined predicting group plate belongs see httpswwwkagglecomzaharchkerasmodelboostedwithplatesleak narrow 1108 class exactly 277 however left simplicity us hungarian algorithm boost result httpswwwkagglecomchandyalexrecursioncellularkerasdensenet score 0113 acheives 0016 boost baseline", "tags_descriptive": []}
