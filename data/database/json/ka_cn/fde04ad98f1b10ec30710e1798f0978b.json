{"title": "See like a Radiologist with Systematic Windowing", "description": "Introduction to DICOM & Voxels What is a DICOM?Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) - an international standard related to the exchange, storage and communication of digital medical images. Prior to this format, there was no standardized way to transfer medical scans. So loading up a single patient's study outside the hospital, in older formats took about 10-30 minutes for a single scan! While DICOM 16-bit images (with values ranging from -32768..32767), other 8-bit greyscale images store values 0 - 255. These value ranges in DICOM are useful, as they correlate with the Hounsfield Scale. Each voxel can store a large amount of information.
