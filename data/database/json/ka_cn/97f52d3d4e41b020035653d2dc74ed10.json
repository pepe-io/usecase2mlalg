However I'm just curious how to work with such amount of data and if I can create something working. Here I'm going to build ML model using Keras. Just to save your time. I have managed to create model which achieved 0.0022% of accuracy after 8 hours of learning.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sergey55/herbarium-2020-notebook", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-04-01 15:21:57", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:41:48", "words": 69, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.09949743747711182, "description_category_runtime": 7.025, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8949211239814758, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.455, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.09949743747711182, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8949211239814758, "runtime_cat": 17.481, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.606", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999954684501173", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "firstly id like say im novice machine learning dont know problem resolved however im curious work amount data create something working im going build ml model using kera save time managed create model achieved 00022 accuracy 8 hour learning", "tags_descriptive": []}
