{"title": "CutMix and MixUp on GPU/TPU", "description": "CutMix and MixUp Augmentation using GPU/TPUThis notebook shows how perform cutmix and mixup data augmentation using the GPU/TPU with TensorFlow.data.Dataset. In our previous notebook here, we demonstrated how to perform rotation, shear, zoom, and shift on GPU/TPU. Performing preprocess on GPU/TPU speeds up our training pipeline and allows us to experiment with more ideas quicker. Libraries like Nvidia DALI here help with GPU image preprocess and/or Nvidia RAPIDS here helps with GPU tabular preprocess.
