{"title": "Beginner's Guide to Audio Data 2", "description": "Freesound Audio Tagging 2019  updated May.02  @fizzbuzz's awesome kernel from previous competition would be a great introduction for beginners, including me :) ( https://www.kaggle.com/fizzbuzz/beginner-s-guide-to-audio-data ) Here I posted the modified kernel for this competition ( though not perfect ).  Also some top solutions in previous competition will help us.  1st solution : https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/365414/9991/Jeong_COCAI_task2.pdf  4th solution : https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/discussion/62634#latest-367166  8th solution : https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/discussion/64262#latest-376395  11th solution : http://dcase.community/documents/workshop2018/proceedings/DCASE2018Workshop_Wei_100.pdf    DCASE_2018 proceedings : http://dcase.community/workshop2018/proceedings   And more... Planet Understanding the Amazon from Space was a multi-labeled image classification competition. https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space 1st place solution had been written in Kaggle blog by @bestfitting. http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/10/17/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space-1st-place-winners-interview/ Most interesting part for me is the way to consider co-occurence. In this solution, Ridge regression was used to do it (please read the above material for more detail).  NOTE : This notebook used only curated wav files, and did not consider multi-labeled records in train. For supplement, I have also posted the kernel to explore multi-label audio data. https://www.kaggle.com/maxwell110/explore-multi-labeled-data Contents Exploratory Data Analysis Loading data Distribution of Categories Reading Audio Files Audio Length   Building a Model using Raw Wave Model Discription Configuration DataGenerator class Normalization Training 1D Conv Ensembling 1D Conv Predictions   Introduction to MFCC Generating MFCC using Librosa   Building a Model using MFCC Preparing Data Normalization Training 2D Conv on MFCC Ensembling 2D Conv Predictions   Ensembling 1D Conv and 2D Conv Predictions   1.
