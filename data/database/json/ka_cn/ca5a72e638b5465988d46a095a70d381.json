{"title": "Dogs vs Cats: Keras Solution", "description": "Building a strong image classification model from less data The implementation is a slight variation of the one in https://gist.github.com/fchollet/0830affa1f7f19fd47b06d4cf89ed44d Mainly, in this kernel , the method flow(x,y) is used whereas, in the above gist, method flow_from_directory(directory) is used. For more info, you can refer https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/ The change is made to have an appropriate kernel to deal with the way data is structured in kaggle. Appropriate changes in other parts of the source code is also done.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sarvajna/dogs-vs-cats-keras-solution", "tags": ["Classification", "CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-01-12 11:29:35", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:58:25", "words": 77, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.09190329909324646, "description_category_runtime": 10.512, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5755400657653809, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.186, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.09190329909324646, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5755400657653809, "runtime_cat": 26.698, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.803", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999971428353898", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "building strong image classification model le data implementation slight variation one httpsgistgithubcomfchollet0830affa1f7f19fd47b06d4cf89ed44d mainly kernel method flowxy used whereas gist method flow_from_directorydirectory used info refer httpskerasiopreprocessingimage change made appropriate kernel deal way data structured kaggle appropriate change part source code also done", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
