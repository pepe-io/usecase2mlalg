{"title": "NFL tracking: wrangling, Voronoi, and sonars", "description": "Dealing with player tracking dataOne initial but tricky issue when working with NFL player tracking data is that sometimes players are moving left to right down the field, and other times those same players are moving right to left. In this walk-through, I do the following:  Standardize player tracking coordinates so that offensive units are moving in the same direction throughout the entirety of the game, while also sharing tweaks that should be made regarding team names.  Create a sample Voronoi diagram using tracking coordinates.  Standardize the direction variable for the ball carrier, and provide video to represent of that standardization manifests itself within a play.  Create angle charts for player movement at a snapshot of time within a play.  Create sonar maps for player direction.   1. Standardizing coordinatesOne recommended technique for working with this data is to standardize play directions, so that the offensive team is always moving in the same direction. This idea is particularly important for this year's Big Data Bowl event on Kaggle, where many participants will look to engineer football-specific features. To start off, let's read in the data, creating a dummy variable for plays moving left to right (ToLeft), as well as an indicator for whether or not the player is the ball carrier (IsBallCarrier). Next, I add in a few tweaks to account for different factors between the PossessionTeam/FieldPosition variables and the HomeTeamAbbr/VisitorTeamAbbr.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/statsbymichaellopez/nfl-tracking-wrangling-voronoi-and-sonars", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-15 17:07:11", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:21:44", "words": 237, "sentences": 11, "sum_nltk": "Dealing with player tracking dataOne initial but tricky issue when working with NFL player tracking data is that sometimes players are moving left to right down the field, and other times those same players are moving right to left.\nIn this walk-through, I do the following:  Standardize player tracking coordinates so that offensive units are moving in the same direction throughout the entirety of the game, while also sharing tweaks that should be made regarding team names.\nCreate a sample Voronoi diagram using tracking coordinates.\nStandardize the direction variable for the ball carrier, and provide video to represent of that standardization manifests itself within a play.\nCreate angle charts for player movement at a snapshot of time within a play.\nCreate sonar maps for player direction.\n1.
