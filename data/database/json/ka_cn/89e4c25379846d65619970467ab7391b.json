{"title": "TReNDS LOFO Feature Importance", "description": "Leave One Feature Out ImportanceIt is difficult to calculate the feature importances with traditional ways in such high dimensional data. Thanks to LOFO, we can group the features and get one importance value for the whole group. In this notebook, while each loading feature is considered as separate feature, fnc features are considered as one group. Then we calculate the feature importances for each target using a ridge regression model within cross-validation.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/aerdem4/trends-lofo-feature-importance", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-17 18:40:33", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:52:38", "words": 72, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.3370426893234253, "description_category_runtime": 7.104, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.42751988768577576, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.966, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.3370426893234253, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.42751988768577576, "runtime_cat": 18.07, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.667", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999964966875415", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "leave one feature importanceit difficult calculate feature importance traditional way high dimensional data thanks lofo group feature get one importance value whole group notebook loading feature considered separate feature fnc feature considered one group calculate feature importance target using ridge regression model within crossvalidation", "tags_descriptive": []}
