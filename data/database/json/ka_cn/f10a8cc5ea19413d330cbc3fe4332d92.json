{"title": "Leakage within the train dataset", "description": "As discussed in the discussion forums (https://www.kaggle.com/c/career-con-2019/discussion/87239#latest-508136) it looks as if each series is part of longer aquisition periods that have been cut up into chunks with 128 samples. This means that each series is not truely independent and there is leakage between them via the orientation data. Therefore if you have any features that use orientation, you will get a very high CV score due to this leakage in the train set. This kernel will show you how it is possible to get a CV score of 0.992 using only the orientation data.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/anjum48/leakage-within-the-train-dataset", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-04-06 19:53:42", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:33:04", "words": 94, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.16772474348545074, "description_category_runtime": 10.052, "description_subcategory": "Transportation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.20144738256931305, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.345, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.16772474348545074, "subcategory": "Transportation", "subcategory_score": 0.20144738256931305, "runtime_cat": 25.396, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.648", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975646075101", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "discussed discussion forum httpswwwkagglecomccareercon2019discussion87239latest508136 look series part longer aquisition period cut chunk 128 sample mean series truely independent leakage via orientation data therefore feature use orientation get high cv score due leakage train set kernel show possible get cv score 0992 using orientation data", "tags_descriptive": []}
