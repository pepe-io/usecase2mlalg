{"title": "SARIMAX on mean visits", "description": "Hello, I started studying time series one week ago and I am not an expert in machine learning. This is my first kernel! I hope to get feedback, in particular I do not know yet how to interpret the Ljung-Box test on the bottom of this notebook. For this competition I noticed a couple of kernels getting stuck with the number of visitors showing a sudden increase in July 2016. That happens simply because in July 2016 there are more restaurants in the data. For this reason I thought of using the mean of visitors and practice with a seasonal ARIMAX model.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/aless80/sarimax-on-mean-visits", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern", "statsmodels"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-13 03:46:55", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:32:50", "words": 102, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.9255412220954895, "description_category_runtime": 9.144, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9280091524124146, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.637, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.9255412220954895, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9280091524124146, "runtime_cat": 22.782, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.746", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999973908714543", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "hello started studying time series one week ago expert machine learning first kernel hope get feedback particular know yet interpret ljungbox test bottom notebook competition noticed couple kernel getting stuck number visitor showing sudden increase july 2016 happens simply july 2016 restaurant data reason thought using mean visitor practice seasonal arimax model", "tags_descriptive": []}
