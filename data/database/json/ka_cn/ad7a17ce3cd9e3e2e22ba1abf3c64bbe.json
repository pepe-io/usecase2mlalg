{"title": "Building a Structured CSV File & Data Dictionary", "description": "Introduction The purpose of this kernel is to convert the collection of 684 job bulletin text files into a single structured .csv file (aka flat file) A job bulletin has a hierarchical structure: within the Carpenter bulletin, the job titles \"carpenter\" and \"cabinetmaker\" are within the apprenticeship experience requirement; another branch of the tree only requires full time paid experience doing carpenter or cabinetmaker work I think that this is the fundamental problem: in a csv, each leaf of the tree should either be on its own line (if it has parents, e.g. a sub-requirement) or in its own column (if it has no parents, e.g. duties or salary).  Getting this right will let us feed the hierarchical structure of requirements directly into a graph of promotions If this csv format is followed, then every line in the csv should correspond to a path in the promotion graph My strategy is to use regular expressions to tokenize the entries in the columns of the structured csv To help with this, I've taken some vocabulary from Los Angeles area college course catalogs", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/claurin1/building-a-structured-csv-file-data-dictionary", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["vocabulary", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-06-21 02:26:51", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:42:37", "words": 182, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.17643627524375916, "description_category_runtime": 15.788, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.29562535881996155, "description_subcategory_runtime": 25.0, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.17643627524375916, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.29562535881996155, "runtime_cat": 40.788, "programming_language": "R notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.675", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999949005645181", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introduction purpose kernel convert collection 684 job bulletin text file single structured csv file aka flat file job bulletin hierarchical structure within carpenter bulletin job title carpenter cabinetmaker within apprenticeship experience requirement another branch tree requires full time paid experience carpenter cabinetmaker work think fundamental problem csv leaf tree either line parent eg subrequirement column parent eg duty salary getting right let u feed hierarchical structure requirement directly graph promotion csv format followed every line csv correspond path promotion graph strategy use regular expression tokenize entry column structured csv help ive taken vocabulary los angeles area college course catalog", "tags_descriptive": []}
