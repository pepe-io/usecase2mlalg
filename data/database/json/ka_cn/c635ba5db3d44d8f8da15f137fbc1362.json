The work has just begun, good results have been obtained. Much work remains to be done, for exampl:  to explore new functions try other models adjust their parameters  I will post all updates here. I ask you to support the project like if it seemed useful to you.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/covid-19-eda-xgboost", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-04-07 13:32:19", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:15:07", "words": 77, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.5862751007080078, "description_category_runtime": 7.142, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4102640748023987, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.967, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.5862751007080078, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.4102640748023987, "runtime_cat": 18.109, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.65", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984273787665", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "covid19 prediction using different modelsin project use data last three month predict confirmed case death month april work begun good result obtained much work remains done exampl explore new function try model adjust parameter post update ask support project like seemed useful", "tags_descriptive": []}
