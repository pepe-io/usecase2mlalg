{"title": "Intel cervical cancer EDA", "description": "Poonam Ligade 16th March 2017 Hi Kagglers, In this notebook I am trying to capture various aspects of data which are images. We have to create an algorithm which  accurately classifies women's cervix type based on images. So its clearly multiclass classification problem where 3 classes are  Type_1  Type_2  Type_3  This will eventually prevent ineffective treatments for wrongly identified cervix types.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/poonaml/intel-cervical-cancer-eda", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-26 12:55:13", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 11:58:48", "words": 66, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.8424293398857117, "description_category_runtime": 6.95, "description_subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5217726826667786, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.718, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.8424293398857117, "subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "subcategory_score": 0.5217726826667786, "runtime_cat": 17.669, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.709", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999970967553378", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "poonam ligade 16th march 2017 hi kagglers notebook trying capture various aspect data image create algorithm accurately classifies woman cervix type based image clearly multiclass classification problem 3 class type_1 type_2 type_3 eventually prevent ineffective treatment wrongly identified cervix type", "tags_descriptive": []}
