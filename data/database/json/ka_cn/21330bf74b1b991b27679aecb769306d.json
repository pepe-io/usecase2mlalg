{"title": "Baseline - Best Constant to Predict for Logloss", "description": "IntroductionIn this kernel we will create a quick baseline by simply predicting the optimum constant for each class. The metric for this competition is multi class logloss. The best constant to predict for this metric is the frequency of each class. This simple and fast solution will serve as a common sense baseline that we can use to see  if using complex and computation intensive machine learning techniques will actually produce real benefits.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/baseline-best-constant-to-predict-for-logloss", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-26 07:27:20", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:35:26", "words": 74, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.11894755810499191, "description_category_runtime": 6.462, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5651388764381409, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.934, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.11894755810499191, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5651388764381409, "runtime_cat": 16.395, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.671", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999960521965159", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionin kernel create quick baseline simply predicting optimum constant class metric competition multi class logloss best constant predict metric frequency class simple fast solution serve common sense baseline use see using complex computation intensive machine learning technique actually produce real benefit", "tags_descriptive": []}
