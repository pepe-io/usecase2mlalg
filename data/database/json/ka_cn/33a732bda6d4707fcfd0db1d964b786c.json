Another one , No man this can't be happening\", Calm down there Pal! , it's just the quarantine , It's messing with Kaggle. Kaggle is going wild with competitons releasing 4th competiton this week, but we need to support Kaggle as good community members right? I mean these are tough times  . This is an interesting competition though,I mean Stegnography, now we are talking, it's time to give all those suppressed spy fantasies we have had for a long time , some air   and dive right in . This competition wants us to create an efficient and reliable method to detect secret data hidden within innocuous-seeming digital images.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077/steganalysis-complete-understanding-and-model", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "CNN", "Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-02 21:26:24", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:29:23", "words": 114, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Government and Public Works", "description_category_score": 0.0310442466288805, "description_category_runtime": 10.966, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.481159508228302, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.612, "category": "Government and Public Works", "category_score": 0.0310442466288805, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.481159508228302, "runtime_cat": 27.579, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.759", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999982545716568", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "competitionwaitwhat another one man cant happening calm pal quarantine messing kaggle kaggle going wild competitons releasing 4th competiton week need support kaggle good community member right mean tough time interesting competition thoughi mean stegnography talking time give suppressed spy fantasy long time air dive right competition want u create efficient reliable method detect secret data hidden within innocuousseeming digital image", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)", "Feature Engineering"]}
