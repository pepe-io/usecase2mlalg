{"title": "EDA iWildCam 2019 v1.1", "description": "Let's have a quick look at the 'iWildCam 2019 - FGVC6' data...Camera Traps (or Wild Cams) enable the automatic collection of large quantities of image data. Biologists all over the world use camera traps to monitor biodiversity and population density of animal species. We have recently been making strides towards automating the species classification challenge in camera traps, but as we try to expand the scope of these models from specific regions where we have collected training data to nearby areas we are faced with an interesting probem: how do you classify a species in a new region that you may not have seen in previous training data?", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/a45632/eda-iwildcam-2019-v1-1", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-27 07:12:21", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:12:46", "words": 108, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.1805715709924698, "description_category_runtime": 9.572, "description_subcategory": "Physical", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5197418332099915, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.607, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.1805715709924698, "subcategory": "Physical", "subcategory_score": 0.5197418332099915, "runtime_cat": 24.179, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.594", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999994488874456", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "let quick look iwildcam 2019 fgvc6 datacamera trap wild cam enable automatic collection large quantity image data biologist world use camera trap monitor biodiversity population density animal specie recently making stride towards automating specie classification challenge camera trap try expand scope model specific region collected training data nearby area faced interesting probem classify specie new region may seen previous training data", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
