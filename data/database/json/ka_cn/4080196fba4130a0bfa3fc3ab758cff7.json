The idea is strongly inspired from https://www.kaggle.com/humananalog/keras-generator-for-reading-directly-from-bson Since I don't have a SSD, the original Generator is ~3s per batch , I just added the feature to read chunks of file and shuffle into batch to improve speed.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/lamdang/fast-shuffle-bson-generator-for-keras", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-10-08 08:29:27", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:44:11", "words": 54, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Manufacturing", "description_category_score": 0.15690965950489044, "description_category_runtime": 7.349, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.42486199736595154, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.367, "category": "Manufacturing", "category_score": 0.15690965950489044, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.42486199736595154, "runtime_cat": 18.716, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.655", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965875746125", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook showcase fast way read data bson generator kera idea strongly inspired httpswwwkagglecomhumananalogkerasgeneratorforreadingdirectlyfrombson since dont ssd original generator 3 per batch added feature read chunk file shuffle batch improve speed", "tags_descriptive": []}
