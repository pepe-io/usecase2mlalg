{"title": "CVPR Image Classes", "description": "IntroIn this kernel I explore the dataset for the CVPR competition. We are given images from videos produced as a car drives around and records activity from the car's point of view. My primary purpose is to see what's in the images and get a general feel for the objects we are asked to segment. I'll also create a data frame of labels for the train set that can be used for more in-depth analysis. Here in this kernel we'll just look at counts and distributions for the train set.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/cvpr-image-classes", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Automotive"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-06-07 01:43:57", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:34:37", "words": 90, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.0026133242063224316, "description_category_runtime": 8.13, "description_subcategory": "Transportation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2318824827671051, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.399, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.0026133242063224316, "subcategory": "Transportation", "subcategory_score": 0.2318824827671051, "runtime_cat": 20.529, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.747", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999995627180921", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introin kernel explore dataset cvpr competition given image video produced car drive around record activity car point view primary purpose see whats image get general feel object asked segment ill also create data frame label train set used indepth analysis kernel well look count distribution train set", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Automotive"]}
