{"title": "Dataset Exploration and Simple On-the-Fly Training", "description": "Everyone is busy downloading and there was no kernel that kind of does the initial exploration to see how the images look like and how would a simple work on this dataset. Hence I went forward and created one. This kernel does not save any file locally and just uses them on the fly during training using a keras generator. Time ranges around ~240secs for an epoch with total 1280 images on a ResNet50 (with very minimal number of classes). There may be a few mistakes, you never know.
