Impact of CTL (Content, Tone, Language) - CoLA", "description": "Data Science For Good : CoLA A Complete Pipeline for Structuring, Analysis and Recommendation Improve Hiring Process and Decisions  Key Objectives: Keeping these challenges in mind, an ideal solution for the City of Los Angeles has following key objectives: Develop an nlp framework to accurately structurize the job descriptions. Develop an analysis framework to identify the implict bias in the text and encourage diversity. Develop a system which can clearly identify the promotion pathways within the organization.My Submission: Following are parts of Kernels Submissions in order:  Part 1: Job Bulletin Structuring Engine - City of Los Angeles   Part 2: Encourage Diversity and Remove Unconsious Bias from Job Bulletins - A Deep Analysis  Part 3: Impact of Content, Tone, and Language : CTL Analysis for CoLA  Part 4: Increasing the Discoverability of Promotional Pathways (Explicit)  Part 5: Implicit Promotional Pathways DiscoverabilityPart 3: Impact of Content, Tone, and Language in Job Bulletins  Other Parts: Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 | Part 4 | Part 5 The aim of this kernel is to provide an analysis framework which performs various types of text analysis on the job bulletins of City of Los Angeles. The goal of all types of analysis is to measure how well the job descriptions are written. The hypothesis is if the text is well written and fully serves its purpose, then it is likely to attract a good quality and quantity of applicants. To validate the hypothesis, I have also created a benchmark index using an indirect method, which can be used to compare CoLA insights with the market insightsTable of Contents1.

Is the format optimal?  6. Tone: What does the Tone and Sentiment of CoLA Job Descriptions suggest? 7. Key Recommendations  1. Why Content, Tone, Language and Layout Matters ?A number of studies (LinkedIn, Forbes, and Glassdoor) have suggested that both the quality and the quantity of applicant's pool can be significantly influenced by how a job description is written. \"A well-written, complete, and insightful job description can result in attracting some of the top and diverse talents for the role\". On the other hand, a description which lacks key features (example - an optimal word limit, choice of the words, language used, overall tone) may result in attracting fewer candidates. It is important for City of Los Angeles to share the job descriptions with optimal and satisfactory content, language, tone, and the layout. The job descriptions are meant to effectively communicate about a particular job class, duties, responsibilities, requirements, and company to the audience. The point worth noting is that, the audience may have versatile backgrounds, demographics, different thought processes, intelligence, intellectuals, and different skills. With such diversity possible in applicants, it become important for the company to make sure that job descriptions are generic and not focussed to target a particular group.  Content: Content plays the most important role in describing the overall quality of a job description. Use of too many words, long paragraphs, and irrelevant verbose may not be perceived equally by all candidates, Especially women who according to Harvard Business Review, tend to get 100% clarity about the job before applying. Another example from Linkedin study was related to length of job descriptions, Shorter job posts garnered a higher application rate than longer ones. Thus, keeping the job description text concise and optimal helps candidates immediately get the info they need.  Tone: For any big company it is important to express a professional tone in the job descriptions. An ideal text should be written in a formal tone and should reflect company's actual culture. The overall tone can be formal, generic or casual tones. Moreover, Use of particular wordings or phrases can also communicate emotional tones, which can have a direct impact on the applicant pool. For instance, more use of words with negative sentiment may reflect a pessimistic tone and may give a bad impression. It may result in only a fraction of potential applicants will apply.  Language: Choice of words and phrases is another important factor that makes up a good job description. Langauge analysis is about evaluating if the text conveys the proper message it is meant to be. One key example is about job duties which are meant to convey what the person will be doing if they are hired. It is possible that langauge or text of job duties section may not properly convey all those actions.    2. Creating A Benchmark Index for Hypothesis Validation The problem statement of this challenge is very open ended and without actual applicant's response data, one cannot validate if all the intution and hypothesis are correct or not. Though I have used a number of other studies and researches conducted by many other companies as the reference to suggest key hypothesis but it is also important to develop a high level validation strategy.  2.1 Analogy of using a Market Benchmark Index  Analogy: In stock markets, investors refer to S&P 500 index which is an aggreagted stock index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or the Cboe BZX Exchange. Investors use this index to understand how the overall market is performing and if their stock is also aligned (or below, or above) with it. Hence, it serve as a benchmark index.      In the similar manner, I created my own benchmark index by analysing the Job Descriptions of Fortune 500 Companies (Forbes: Fortune 500 companies). Use of this index, gives us a \"Industry\" benchmark (similar to \"market\" in S&P 500). Ofcourse, this index may not convey an exact reflection of metrics but this index definately gives the most ideal metrics which are used by some of the top and big companies having diverse sectors.    To state an example, it will be interesting to compare what is the average number of words used in City of Los Angeles job descriptions and that of Fortune 500 companies descriptions.      The following diagram explains how I developed this index   I obtained the list of 2019 fortune 500 companies from Forbes. I made different input queries (location=\"la\", role=\"CityofLA Job Roles\", company=\"One of the 500 companies\") and queried them in Free Public API of Indeed to obtain the job bulletins of these 500 companies. I obtained maximum three job descriptions per company, obtained the text data, and calculated all the relevant metrics to be used as a benchmark. The script of this process is shared in the next cell. The code is commented, it requires two arguments - API_KEY (which can be obtained from this link - https://opensource.indeedeng.io/api-documentation/) and a list of job roles to be searched. Adding this benchmark comparison gives a data-driven perspective to this problem along with our hypothesis.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/3-impact-of-ctl-content-tone-language-cola", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["nltk", "spacy", "pattern", "textblob"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-06-21 08:53:07", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:42:37", "words": 1293, "sentences": 50, "sum_nltk": "Data Science For Good : CoLA A Complete Pipeline for Structuring, Analysis and Recommendation Improve Hiring Process and Decisions  Key Objectives: Keeping these challenges in mind, an ideal solution for the City of Los Angeles has following key objectives: Develop an nlp framework to accurately structurize the job descriptions.\nTo validate the hypothesis, I have also created a benchmark index using an indirect method, which can be used to compare CoLA insights with the market insightsTable of Contents1.\n2.
