{"title": " FasterRCNN Pseudo Labeling", "description": "# ** FasterRCNN Pseudo LabelingIn this nodebook, I am going to test the pseudo labeling for this dataset. The training data is small, therefore more data usually help.  I use a published fasterRCNN model and then continue train it for 3 more epochs with pseudo labeling.  By using this technique, I improve the LB from 0.6687 to 0.6937  You can find the train notebook here Inference notebook here The weights are available here  I also published 2 notebooks of centernet training and inference Centernet Training notebook ** Centernet Inference notebook Your upvotes will be my motivation to upgrade those notenote as I make improvements", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/nvnnghia/fasterrcnn-pseudo-labeling", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pytorch", "albumentations"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-09 13:31:57", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:14:55", "words": 108, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.4524594843387604, "description_category_runtime": 10.409, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9107452034950256, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.774, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.4524594843387604, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9107452034950256, "runtime_cat": 26.184, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.757", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999982692840003", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "fasterrcnn pseudo labelingin nodebook going test pseudo labeling dataset training data small therefore data usually help use published fasterrcnn model continue train 3 epoch pseudo labeling using technique improve lb 06687 06937 find train notebook inference notebook weight available also published 2 notebook centernet training inference centernet training notebook centernet inference notebook upvotes motivation upgrade notenote make improvement", "tags_descriptive": []}
