{"title": "Baseline with News", "description": "1. Introduction and loading dataThere are two sets of data in this 'kernels only' competition: News and Prices/Returns. The ideia is to use both sets to predict the movement of a given financial asset in the next 10 days. We have data from 2007 to 2017 for training and must predict the movement of assets from Jan 2017 to July 2019. Two Sigma and Kaggle created a custom package for this competition:", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jsaguiar/baseline-with-news", "tags": ["Finance", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-11-25 22:10:18", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:02:27", "words": 72, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.7834140062332153, "description_category_runtime": 7.023, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2928066849708557, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.818, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.7834140062332153, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.2928066849708557, "runtime_cat": 17.841, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.748", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999973069925289", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "1 introduction loading datathere two set data kernel competition news pricesreturns ideia use set predict movement given financial asset next 10 day data 2007 2017 training must predict movement asset jan 2017 july 2019 two sigma kaggle created custom package competition", "tags_descriptive": ["Finance", "Classification"]}
