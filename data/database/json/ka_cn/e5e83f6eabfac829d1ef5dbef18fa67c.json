{"title": "for_Japanese_beginner(with WRMSSE in LGBM))", "description": "I have updated this notebook to modify the wrmsse function  at 29th Mar. New wrmsse function for LGBM metric calculate wrmsse only for last 28 days to consider non-zero demand period. Please refer comment section. I have commented the detail of my fixing. (note:I have also remove some variable to reduce the run-time and changed 'objective' in lgbm to 'poisson'.) This kernel is:  Based on Very fst Model. Thanks @ragnar123.   Based on m5-baseline. Thank @harupy. to explain the detail of these great notebook by Japanese especially for beginner.    Additionaly, I have added an relatively efficient evaluation of WRSSE for LGBM metric to these kernel.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/girmdshinsei/for-japanese-beginner-with-wrmsse-in-lgbm", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "tensorflow", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-29 10:57:31", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:22:57", "words": 111, "sentences": 10, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.2595832347869873, "description_category_runtime": 11.737, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.38696810603141785, "description_subcategory_runtime": 18.153, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.2595832347869873, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.38696810603141785, "runtime_cat": 29.89, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.767", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965576347865", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "updated notebook modify wrmsse function 29th mar new wrmsse function lgbm metric calculate wrmsse last 28 day consider nonzero demand period please refer comment section commented detail fixing notei also remove variable reduce runtime changed objective lgbm poisson kernel based fst model thanks ragnar123 based m5baseline thank harupy explain detail great notebook japanese especially beginner additionaly added relatively efficient evaluation wrsse lgbm metric kernel", "tags_descriptive": []}
