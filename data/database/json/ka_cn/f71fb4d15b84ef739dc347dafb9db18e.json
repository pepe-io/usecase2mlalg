{"title": "Aggregated features & LightGBM", "description": "In this kernel we will take a look at engineering aggregated features. Specifically, we will engineer 3 aggregated features using train_active.csv, test_active.csv, periods_test.csv and periods_test.csv. Those features will be:  avg_times_up_user - how often the average item of the user has been put up for sale. avg_days_up_user - the average number of days an item from the user has been put up for sale. n_user_items - the number of items the user has put up for sale.  Let's see if they help :)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/bminixhofer/aggregated-features-lightgbm", "tags": ["Feature Engineering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "nltk", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-05-19 23:38:03", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:57:27", "words": 84, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.46725863218307495, "description_category_runtime": 9.473, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6240540742874146, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.583, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.46725863218307495, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6240540742874146, "runtime_cat": 24.057, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.761", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999964889959584", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel take look engineering aggregated feature specifically engineer 3 aggregated feature using train_activecsv test_activecsv periods_testcsv periods_testcsv feature avg_times_up_user often average item user put sale avg_days_up_user average number day item user put sale n_user_items number item user put sale let see help", "tags_descriptive": ["Feature Engineering"]}
