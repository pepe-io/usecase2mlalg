This is my second submission for Kaggle's iMet 2020 \u2014 FGVC7 competition. Here we are checking some approaches taught on fastai's classes. There are a lot of inspiration from other places to this; you can find the references at the bottom, ok?  Notes: in this third iteration, we increased the batch size a little bit more, and also number of epochs on the first and second training rounds.  We start importing everything from fastai.vision.
