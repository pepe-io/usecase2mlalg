{"title": "Full Classification Example with ConvNet", "description": "Full run through of raw images to classification with Convolutional Neural NetworkIn this tutorial, we're going to be running through taking raw images that have been labeled for us already, and then feeding them through a convolutional neural network for classification. The images are either of dog(s) or cat(s). Once you have downloaded and extracted the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data, you're ready to begin.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sentdex/full-classification-example-with-convnet", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-02-22 23:29:35", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:58:25", "words": 63, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.18450090289115906, "description_category_runtime": 8.195, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9690603613853455, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.146, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.18450090289115906, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9690603613853455, "runtime_cat": 21.341, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.79", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999956826717225", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "full run raw image classification convolutional neural networkin tutorial going running taking raw image labeled u already feeding convolutional neural network classification image either dog cat downloaded extracted data httpswwwkagglecomcdogsvscatsreduxkernelseditiondata youre ready begin", "tags_descriptive": []}
