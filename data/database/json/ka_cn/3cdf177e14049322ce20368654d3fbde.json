{"title": "PCA-MLP VS PCA-CNN , Focal Loss resnet50 vs Vgg16", "description": "IntroductionIn this short notebook I wanted to experiment with PCA and neural network implemented with Keras library. Also I would like to ilustrate how PCA decomposition works on data from this dataset. Most important thing, I would like hopefully to get some feedback to improve this method or find completely different approach. Thanks to other authors for publishing their notebooks, I reused some parts of the code when I was looking for fiding nice solutions for problems I had on a way.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/rohandx1996/pca-mlp-vs-pca-cnn-focal-loss-resnet50-vs-vgg16", "tags": ["DL", "CNN"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-23 09:44:17", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:10:46", "words": 82, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.27570828795433044, "description_category_runtime": 7.517, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.696434497833252, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.63, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.27570828795433044, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.696434497833252, "runtime_cat": 19.147, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.652", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999998133502837", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionin short notebook wanted experiment pca neural network implemented kera library also would like ilustrate pca decomposition work data dataset important thing would like hopefully get feedback improve method find completely different approach thanks author publishing notebook reused part code looking fiding nice solution problem way", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
