I also showed a few examples of how to visualize these scores, but I didn't even scratch the surface into other things you can do with this dataframe of scores, namely compare to other models and find which performs best on which series/quantile combinations. version 11: added an easy to use WSPLEvaluator object to my utility script. You can find this at the end of the notebook.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/chrisrichardmiles/m5u-wsplevaluator-weighted-scaled-pinball-loss", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-06-09 00:18:28", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:24:02", "words": 88, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.43780043721199036, "description_category_runtime": 8.38, "description_subcategory": "Physical", "description_subcategory_score": 0.24209804832935333, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.987, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.43780043721199036, "subcategory": "Physical", "subcategory_score": 0.24209804832935333, "runtime_cat": 21.367, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.615", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999964875781041", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "version unpdatesversion 14 changed object scores_df attribute show score series quantiles also showed example visualize score didnt even scratch surface thing dataframe score namely compare model find performs best seriesquantile combination version 11 added easy use wsplevaluator object utility script find end notebook", "tags_descriptive": []}
