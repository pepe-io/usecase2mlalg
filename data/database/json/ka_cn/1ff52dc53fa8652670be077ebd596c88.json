{"title": "remove drift using a sine function", "description": "IntroductionIn this notebook, I'll share my approach to finding synthetic drift function. It is no secret that the drift has been artificially added. In this competition's paper here, you can find the description of the data like below: \"In some datasets additional drift was applied to the final data with MATLAB\"  There's an excellent explanation for the drift. Please check Chris' explanation: What is Drift?", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/eunholee/remove-drift-using-a-sine-function", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-21 09:38:19", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:17:30", "words": 66, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.004, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.1371491551399231, "description_category_runtime": 6.748, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2038639932870865, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.165, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.1371491551399231, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.2038639932870865, "runtime_cat": 16.912, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.708", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972709309042", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionin notebook ill share approach finding synthetic drift function secret drift artificially added competition paper find description data like datasets additional drift applied final data matlab there excellent explanation drift please check chris explanation drift", "tags_descriptive": []}
