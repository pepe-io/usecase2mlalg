{"title": "DS-Tutorial-(PCA+Gussian_Mixture+Grid_Search)", "description": "Introduction:This tutorial is for beginners learning the concept of Scikit-Learn library which is a high level framework designed for supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, built on top of NumPy and SciPy libraries, each responsible for lower-level data science tasks. This tutorial seeks inspiration from https://www.kaggle.com/chahat1/data-science-london-classification The sequence of steps are as follows:  Check for missing values in the dataset Pre-process data by splitting into Train-Test sets Models Classification Feature Scaling by standardizing and normalizing your data Learn its effect by improved accuracy    Reduce the dimension of your data using PCA Learn its effect by improved accuracy    Applying Gaussian Mixture and Grid Search Learn its effect by improved accuracy    Fit our best model", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sabahkarim/ds-tutorial-pca-gussian-mixture-grid-search", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "tensorflow", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-09-06 15:47:31", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:43:22", "words": 123, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.17309175431728363, "description_category_runtime": 12.421, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9633503556251526, "description_subcategory_runtime": 18.9, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.17309175431728363, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9633503556251526, "runtime_cat": 31.322, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.615", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999980740771149", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionthis tutorial beginner learning concept scikitlearn library high level framework designed supervised unsupervised machine learning algorithm built top numpy scipy library responsible lowerlevel data science task tutorial seek inspiration httpswwwkagglecomchahat1datasciencelondonclassification sequence step follows check missing value dataset preprocess data splitting traintest set model classification feature scaling standardizing normalizing data learn effect improved accuracy reduce dimension data using pca learn effect improved accuracy applying gaussian mixture grid search learn effect improved accuracy fit best model", "tags_descriptive": []}
