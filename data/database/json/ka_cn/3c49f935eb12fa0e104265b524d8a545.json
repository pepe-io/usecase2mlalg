{"title": "Feature Slection Lasso,Ridge,Linear Models", "description": "In this kernel we will see how to do Feature Selection.We will be using Lasso,Ridge and Embeded technique.Regularization means adding penalty to the parameters of the machine learning model.THis helps in reducing the freedom of the model.Lasso regression has the ability to shrink the coefficinets to zero.This helps in carrying out feature selection.This Kernel is a work in process and I will be updating the kernel in coming days.If you like my work please do vote.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/biphili/feature-slection-lasso-ridge-linear-models", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-04-07 09:02:33", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:27:17", "words": 76, "sentences": 1, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.2268902212381363, "description_category_runtime": 7.865, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9653068780899048, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.34, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.2268902212381363, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9653068780899048, "runtime_cat": 20.205, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.613", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999957479885794", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel see feature selectionwe using lassoridge embeded techniqueregularization mean adding penalty parameter machine learning modelthis help reducing freedom modellasso regression ability shrink coefficinets zerothis help carrying feature selectionthis kernel work process updating kernel coming daysif like work please vote", "tags_descriptive": []}
