{"title": "Object Detection YOLOV2", "description": "Object Detection using YOLOV2 This is a starter kernel, mainly for learning purposes and getting started. There is so much to learn more and improve. I am using YOLOv2 model for object classification and detection using a pretrained model. I could not consolidate all the functions into a dataset and import in the Notebook so i had to put all the code here! Sorry about that. I am still new to Kaggle! Goal is to get an idea on how YOLO algorithm works in detail step by step. Hope this helps :-) References: The ideas presented in this notebook came primarily from the two YOLO papers. The implementation here also took significant inspiration and used many components from Allan Zelener's github repository. The pretrained weights used in this exercise came from the official YOLO website. Check the speed of detection using YOLO!
