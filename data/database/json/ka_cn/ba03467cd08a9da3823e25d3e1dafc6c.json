{"title": "Using fastai in Kaggle Kernel  (Updated)", "description": "UpdatedNow using all 25000 images of the dataset since Kaggle increased available disk space to 5.2 GB. Thank you Kaggle! Previous Version (Score: 0.07092)I have used only 16000 of the available 25000 images of the training data due to kaggle kernel limitations of Disk space. Please make the necessary changes in the code if you want to train on the complete dataset. I realize this is not a well explained kernel, but I primarily wrote this to verify if it was possible to come up with an end-to-end solution using fastai inside kaggle kernels", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/anshulrai/using-fastai-in-kaggle-kernel-updated", "tags": ["DL", "Transfer Learning"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-08-01 05:25:18", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:58:25", "words": 94, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.08795793354511261, "description_category_runtime": 9.329, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7769165635108948, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.328, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.08795793354511261, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7769165635108948, "runtime_cat": 23.658, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.731", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975864493027", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "updatednow using 25000 image dataset since kaggle increased available disk space 52 gb thank kaggle previous version score 007092i used 16000 available 25000 image training data due kaggle kernel limitation disk space please make necessary change code want train complete dataset realize well explained kernel primarily wrote verify possible come endtoend solution using fastai inside kaggle kernel", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Transfer Learning"]}
