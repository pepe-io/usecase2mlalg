{"title": "Lets try XGBoost Simple W/Added Features", "description": "INTRODUCTION:This is a very simple implementation of XGBoost for this data. One of the great features of XGBoost is that it has built in functionality to easily see the top features F score. This means we can add a lot of features to the model and then easily see what really makes a difference in prediction. This is extremely important for this challenge since it is not really about the leaderboard results, it is more about determining useful features for models. I am working on collecting publicly available datasets to continue to add in new variables (features) to see what might be useful.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jasonbenner/lets-try-xgboost-simple-w-added-features", "tags": ["Xgboost"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-26 00:06:05", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:11:58", "words": 103, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.29179224371910095, "description_category_runtime": 9.195, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4500606060028076, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.231, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.29179224371910095, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.4500606060028076, "runtime_cat": 23.426, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.709", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965150263013", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionthis simple implementation xgboost data one great feature xgboost built functionality easily see top feature f score mean add lot feature model easily see really make difference prediction extremely important challenge since really leaderboard result determining useful feature model working collecting publicly available datasets continue add new variable feature see might useful", "tags_descriptive": ["Xgboost"]}
