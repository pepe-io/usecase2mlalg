{"title": "Jigsaw TPU: BERT with Huggingface and Keras", "description": "About this notebookJigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification is the 3rd annual competition organized by the Jigsaw team. It follows Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, the original 2018 competition, and Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification, which required the competitors to consider biased ML predictions in their new models. This year, the goal is to use english only training data to run toxicity predictions on many different languages, which can be done using multilingual models, and speed up using TPUs. Many awesome notebooks has already been made so far. Many of them used really cool technologies like Pytorch XLA. This notebook instead aims at constructing a fast, concise, reusable, and beginner-friendly model scaffold. It will focus on the following points:  Using Tensorflow and Keras: Tensorflow is a powerful framework, and Keras makes the training process extremely easy to understand. This is especially good for beginners to learn how to use TPUs, and for experts to focus on the modelling aspect. Using Huggingface's transformers library: This library is extremely popular, so using this let you easily integrate the end result into your ML pipelines, and can be easily reused for your other projects. Native TPU usage: The TPU usage is abstracted using the native strategy that was created using Tensorflow's tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy. This avoids getting too much into the lower-level aspect of TPU management. Use a subset of the data: Instead of using the entire dataset, we will only use the 2018 subset of the data available, which makes this much faster, all while achieving a respectable accuracy.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/miklgr500/jigsaw-tpu-bert-with-huggingface-and-keras", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "nltk", "tensorflow", "sklearn", "vocabulary"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-28 16:15:58", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:15:35", "words": 255, "sentences": 12, "sum_nltk": "About this notebookJigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification is the 3rd annual competition organized by the Jigsaw team.\nIt follows Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, the original 2018 competition, and Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification, which required the competitors to consider biased ML predictions in their new models.\nThis year, the goal is to use english only training data to run toxicity predictions on many different languages, which can be done using multilingual models, and speed up using TPUs.
