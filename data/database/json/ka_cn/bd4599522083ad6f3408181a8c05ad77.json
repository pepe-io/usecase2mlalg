{"title": "Cat & Dog Classification using Keras CNN", "description": "IntroductionConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are everywhere. It is arguably the most popular deep learning architecture. The main advantage of CNN compared to its predecessors is that it automatically detects the important features without any human supervision. For example, given many pictures of cats and dogs it learns distinctive features for each class by itself. CNN is also computationally efficient. It uses special convolution and pooling operations and performs parameter sharing. This enables CNN models to run on any device, making them universally attractive.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/dktalaicha/cat-dog-classification-using-keras-cnn", "tags": ["CNN"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-25 20:29:15", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:56:58", "words": 83, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.234126016497612, "description_category_runtime": 7.914, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8971560597419739, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.161, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.234126016497612, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8971560597419739, "runtime_cat": 20.075, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.615", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999931653931513", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionconvolutional neural network cnn everywhere arguably popular deep learning architecture main advantage cnn compared predecessor automatically detects important feature without human supervision example given many picture cat dog learns distinctive feature class cnn also computationally efficient us special convolution pooling operation performs parameter sharing enables cnn model run device making universally attractive", "tags_descriptive": ["Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
