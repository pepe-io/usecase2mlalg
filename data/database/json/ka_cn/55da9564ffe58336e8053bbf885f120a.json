{"title": "CNN 2D Basic Solution Powered by fast.ai", "description": "CNN 2D Basic Solution Powered by fast.aiThis kernel explains basic solution that I've used in the last competition and many of top competitors also. It's CNN, even ImageNet pretrained model works fine with audio 2D image like data. Will show:  Converting audio to 2D image like array, so that we can simply exploit strong CNN classifier. fast.ai to build fast and strong multi-label classifier model. Unlike normal use, we need to train from scratch to comply competition rule. (Though if we use ImageNet pretrained model, it converges super fast...) With simple codes.  Update 30-Apr, 2019 Now fast.ai library ready to use lwlrap as metric: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AgPdhSp7ttY18O3fEoHOQKlt_3HJDLi8 And TTA! https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/vision/tta.py --> Oops, it might not be effective for this problem. Now planning to update one more...  Update 28-Apr, 2019 Removed EasyDict dependency.
