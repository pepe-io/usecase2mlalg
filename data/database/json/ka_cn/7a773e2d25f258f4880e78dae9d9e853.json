{"title": "Flow_from_dataframe: A memory-friendly approach ", "description": "Working with images is pretty memory consuming, especially if you read and preprocess all of them at the same time. The following approach avoids this problem in Keras, leaving more space in memory to use augmentation and/or loading pre-trained models. I hope this helps Kagglers to work on their networks in Kaggle kernels without worrying (or at least worrying less) with the 14GB of memory provided using GPU environment. I tried to comment the comment the code as clearer as I could, but if some part was not well-explained or if you have doubts, ask on the comments :) Contents  (Very) brief data exploration Training models using generators and flow_from_dataframe", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/hrmello/flow-from-dataframe-a-memory-friendly-approach", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-06 19:37:51", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 21:28:20", "words": 111, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.09624781459569931, "description_category_runtime": 10.488, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.45125895738601685, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.897, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.09624781459569931, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.45125895738601685, "runtime_cat": 26.387, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.7", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999984858728966", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "working image pretty memory consuming especially read preprocess time following approach avoids problem kera leaving space memory use augmentation andor loading pretrained model hope help kagglers work network kaggle kernel without worrying least worrying le 14gb memory provided using gpu environment tried comment comment code clearer could part wellexplained doubt ask comment content brief data exploration training model using generator flow_from_dataframe", "tags_descriptive": []}
