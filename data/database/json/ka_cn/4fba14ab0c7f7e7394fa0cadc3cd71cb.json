It is possible to get this way 0.48+ LB  As it is shown in this kernel, it would be also possible to identify the delimiters used (at least for difficulty 1 and 2), even without decryting the full text. With that knowledge it would be possible to get even a better result without seeing the plain texts or using brute force.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/lbronchal/without-breaking-ciphers-0-48-lb", "tags": ["NLP", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-20 01:28:46", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:01:56", "words": 80, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.5551049709320068, "description_category_runtime": 7.425, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.735700786113739, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.581, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.5551049709320068, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.735700786113739, "runtime_cat": 19.006, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.635", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999976931830736", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "quite fast solution working encrypted text without use brute force possible get way 048 lb shown kernel would also possible identify delimiters used least difficulty 1 2 even without decryting full text knowledge would possible get even better result without seeing plain text using brute force", "tags_descriptive": ["Natural Language Processing (NLP)", "Classification"]}
