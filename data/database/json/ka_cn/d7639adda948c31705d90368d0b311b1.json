{"title": "DSL and Genetic Algorithm applied to ARC", "description": "A DSL alongside a Genetic Algorithm applied to the ARC DatasetIn this notebook, we present a minimalistic Domain Specific Language for some of the ARC tasks. We instroduce the language and how it can be used to precess the input in complex ways. We then implement an evaluation function able to run a such program against an input image. We also provide a program solution of a task as an exemple. In a second time, we implement a simple genetic algorithm (based on a multiobjective and elitist strategy) that is able to generate programs written in this DSL and demonstrate its usage against the same ARC task previously solved by hand.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/zenol42/dsl-and-genetic-algorithm-applied-to-arc", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-10 22:32:28", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:09:11", "words": 111, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.15475624799728394, "description_category_runtime": 9.938, "description_subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "description_subcategory_score": 0.24276331067085266, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.461, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.15475624799728394, "subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "subcategory_score": 0.24276331067085266, "runtime_cat": 25.4, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.744", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972235030489", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "dsl alongside genetic algorithm applied arc datasetin notebook present minimalistic domain specific language arc task instroduce language used precess input complex way implement evaluation function able run program input image also provide program solution task exemple second time implement simple genetic algorithm based multiobjective elitist strategy able generate program written dsl demonstrate usage arc task previously solved hand", "tags_descriptive": []}
