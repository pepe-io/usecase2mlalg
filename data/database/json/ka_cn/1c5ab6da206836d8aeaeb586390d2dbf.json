{"title": "WaveNet-Keras", "description": "The validation scheme is based on seq2seq-rnn-with-gru, and cleaned data is from data-without-drift and Kalman filter is from https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/single-model-lgbm-kalman-filter and the added feature is from wavenet-with-1-more-feature. I also used ragnar's data in this version clean-kalman. The Wavenet is based on https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn, https://github.com/peustr/wavenet and https://github.com/basveeling/wavenet and also https://www.kaggle.com/wimwim/wavenet-lstm.
