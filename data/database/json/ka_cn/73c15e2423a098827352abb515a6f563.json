{"title": "LightGBM on Meta-Features", "description": "OVERVIEWIn this notebook, we will check if there is any predictive power in the meta-features that can be extracted from the DCM images. We will write a function to extract a few meta-features and pixel-based features taking advantage of the parallelization and build a cross-validation based LightGBM pipeline to predict one image-level and nine exam-level labels.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kozodoi/lightgbm-on-meta-features", "tags": ["Gradient Boosting", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-10-09 18:34:53", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:49:33", "words": 56, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.21779362857341766, "description_category_runtime": 6.528, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4306553900241852, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.859, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.21779362857341766, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.4306553900241852, "runtime_cat": 16.388, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.692", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999957638502429", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overviewin notebook check predictive power metafeatures extracted dcm image write function extract metafeatures pixelbased feature taking advantage parallelization build crossvalidation based lightgbm pipeline predict one imagelevel nine examlevel label", "tags_descriptive": ["Gradient Boosting", "Classification"]}
