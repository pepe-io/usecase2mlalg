{"title": "Inception3 - last years baseline", "description": "iNaturalist Competition 2018 Training CodeI did not write the following code myself. I copied this from last years baseline and only did some refactorization to make the code run in this kernel. Actually, I was just exploring the dataset and trying to see how past solutions do. All the credit goes to user macaoda. So far, I managed to make the pre trained model run and also trained it on a few epochs over the training data. As you can see, the scores do not match this years baseline yet. According to user zz, scores of at least 0.22 are possible with slight changes. Sadly, I will not be able to spend more time with this competition. Hope, this kernel helps you in some way.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/feichin/inception3-last-years-baseline", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-04-09 05:31:41", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 11:42:48", "words": 125, "sentences": 9, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.15462583303451538, "description_category_runtime": 11.178, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.3430993854999542, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.023, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.15462583303451538, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.3430993854999542, "runtime_cat": 28.201, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.675", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972196556974", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "inaturalist competition 2018 training codei write following code copied last year baseline refactorization make code run kernel actually exploring dataset trying see past solution credit go user macaoda far managed make pre trained model run also trained epoch training data see score match year baseline yet according user zz score least 022 possible slight change sadly able spend time competition hope kernel help way", "tags_descriptive": []}
