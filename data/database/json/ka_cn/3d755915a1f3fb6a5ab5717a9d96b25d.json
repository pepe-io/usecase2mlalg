I uploaded trained models as dataset lyft-resnet18-baseline Please upvote the dataset as well if this kernel helps you :)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/corochann/lyft-prediction-with-multi-mode-confidence", "tags": ["Automotive", "CNN"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["xgboost", "lightgbm", "sklearn", "pytorch", "catboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-26 10:26:33", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:21:26", "words": 74, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.3559262752532959, "description_category_runtime": 8.656, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9869191646575928, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.346, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.3559262752532959, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9869191646575928, "runtime_cat": 22.002, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.735", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999948574912755", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "lyft prediction multimode confidence image l5kit official document httpwwwl5kitorgreadmehtml continued previous kernel lyft comprehensive guide start competition lyft deep l5kit library lyft training multimode confidence kernel run prediction code competition submission model trained previous kernel uploaded trained model dataset lyftresnet18baseline please upvote dataset well kernel help", "tags_descriptive": ["Automotive", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
