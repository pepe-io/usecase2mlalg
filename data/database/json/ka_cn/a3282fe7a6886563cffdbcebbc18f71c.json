{"title": "CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection ", "description": "RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge with ChexNet Why to detetct this Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease.  In the United States,  pneumonia accounts for over 500,000 visits to emergency departments [1] and over 50,000 deaths in 2015 [2], keeping the ailment on the list of top 10 causes of death in the country.  Symptoms to detect Pneumonia The Diagnosis of pneumonia on CXR( is complicated because of a number of other nditions in the lungsuch as uid overload (pulmonary edema), bleeding, volume loss (atelectasis or collapse), lung cancer, or post-radiation or surgical changes.    Characteristics Pneumonia   History Underlying lung disease, contact with individuals having upper or lower respiratory infection, contact with birds/animals.   Causes Bacteria, virus, fungi; aspiration.   Body systems  Respiratory system\u2014lungs.   Clinical symptoms High fever (sometimes with chills and rigors), cough, wheezing, breathing difficulty, chest pain.   Investigations Blood investigations\u2014complete blood count, ESR, sputum examination and culture, chest X-ray, CT scan, bronchoscopy, thoracocentesis, pleural fluid aspiration and culture.   Treatments Appropriate antimicrobial therapy, expectorant, antipyretics and analgesics, oxygen therapy (if required), fluids.  Table References Goal of This competition In this competition, the primary endpoint will be the detection of bounding boxes corresponding to the diagnosis of pneumonia (e.g. lung infection) on chest radiographs, a special 2D high resolution grayscale medical image.  Note that pnuemonia is just one of many possible disease processes that can occur on a chest radiograph, and that any given single image may contain 0, 1 or many boxes corresponding to possible pneumonia locations.

Filenames are also patient names.  Stage 1 Labels - stage_1_train_labels.csv and Stage 1 Sample Submission stage_1_sample_submission.csv Which provides the IDs for the test set, as well as a sample of what your submission should look like  Stage 1 Detailed Info - stage_1_detailed_class_info.csv contains detailed information about the positive and negative classes in the training set, and may be used to build more nuanced models.   File descriptions  stage_1_train.csv\u00a0- the training set. Contains\u00a0patientIds and bounding box / target information. stage_1_sample_submission.csv\u00a0- a sample submission file in the correct format. Contains\u00a0patientIds for the test set. Note that the sample submission contains one box per image, but there is no limit to the number of bounding boxes that can be assigned to a given image. stage_1_detailed_class_info.csv\u00a0- provides detailed information about the type of positive or negative class for each image.  Data fields  patientId\u00a0_- A\u00a0patientId.
