{"title": "Are Men's and Women's tournaments different?", "description": "The goal of this notebook is to explore the data of both the Men's and Women's competitions and answering the following questions:  How did the game evolved over the years? What stats are most useful to predict the outcome of a game? What are the differences between the Men's and Women's competitions?  To do so, we need to produce some aggregated statistics.
