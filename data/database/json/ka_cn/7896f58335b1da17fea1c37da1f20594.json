{"title": "Simple EDA - Two Sigma", "description": "In this notebook I'll try to explore the basic information about the dataset to help us build our models / features. Data descriptionEach asset is identified by an assetCode (note that a single company may have multiple assetCodes). Depending on what you wish to do, you may use the assetCode, assetName, or time as a way to join the market data to news data. The marketdata contains a variety of returns calculated over different timespans. All of the returns in this set of marketdata have these properties:  Returns are always calculated either open-to-open (from the opening time of one trading day to the open of another) or close-to-close (from the closing time of one trading day to the open of another). Returns are either raw, meaning that the data is not adjusted against any benchmark, or market-residualized (Mktres), meaning that the movement of the market as a whole has been accounted for, leaving only movements inherent to the instrument. Returns can be calculated over any arbitrary interval. Provided here are 1 day and 10 day horizons. Returns are tagged with 'Prev' if they are backwards looking in time, or 'Next' if forwards looking.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/pestipeti/simple-eda-two-sigma", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-09-27 22:23:43", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:02:27", "words": 194, "sentences": 9, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.012888539582490921, "description_category_runtime": 17.038, "description_subcategory": "Trading & Investment", "description_subcategory_score": 0.007817932404577732, "description_subcategory_runtime": 27.7, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.012888539582490921, "subcategory": "Trading & Investment", "subcategory_score": 0.007817932404577732, "runtime_cat": 44.738, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.757", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999964964443475", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook ill try explore basic information dataset help u build model feature data descriptioneach asset identified assetcode note single company may multiple assetcodes depending wish may use assetcode assetname time way join market data news data marketdata contains variety return calculated different timespans return set marketdata property return always calculated either opentoopen opening time one trading day open another closetoclose closing time one trading day open another return either raw meaning data adjusted benchmark marketresidualized mktres meaning movement market whole accounted leaving movement inherent instrument return calculated arbitrary interval provided 1 day 10 day horizon return tagged prev backwards looking time next forward looking", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
