{"title": "CVPR EDA with faster labeling", "description": "IntroIn this kernel I explore the dataset for the CVPR competition. We are given images from videos produced as a car drives around and records activity from the car's point of view. My primary purpose is to see what's in the images and get a general feel for the objects we are asked to segment. I'll also create a data frame of labels for the train set that can be used for more in-depth classification. New: I've been trying to optimize the code for reading all train images and generating the labels. Maybe you have some ideas to speed it up?.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/bisonsam/cvpr-eda-with-faster-labeling", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-04-19 06:43:48", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:34:37", "words": 101, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.11663221567869186, "description_category_runtime": 8.815, "description_subcategory": "Transportation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7197402119636536, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.937, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.11663221567869186, "subcategory": "Transportation", "subcategory_score": 0.7197402119636536, "runtime_cat": 22.752, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.592", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999979287407106", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introin kernel explore dataset cvpr competition given image video produced car drive around record activity car point view primary purpose see whats image get general feel object asked segment ill also create data frame label train set used indepth classification new ive trying optimize code reading train image generating label maybe idea speed", "tags_descriptive": []}
