{"title": "Cipher Level 1,2 - Simple EDA on Level 3,4", "description": "[Credit to https://www.kaggle.com/kaggleuser58/cipher-challenge-iii-level-1] IntroductionTime to share solution of cipher level 2 so you can look at the next level.In the previous Cipher Challenge II one of the levels was a cipher with multiple substitutions generated from a key of length 8 if I remember correct. The level 1 of this Cipher Challenge III is the same kind but with a key of length 4, so only 4 substitutions are used for each character mapping. See https://www.kaggle.com/kaggleuser58/cipher-challenge-iii-level-1 The level 2 of this Cipher Challenge III is a transposition cipher on top of level 1. See https://www.kaggle.com/c/ciphertext-challenge-iii/discussion/103969#latest-598262 The cipher The cipher only apllies to UPPERCASE and LOWERCASE letters. The key only shifts every time an UPPERCASE or LOWERCASE letter is met.  PaddingFrom Cipher Challenge II it was found that padding could be done both up front and in the end. Number of padding characters in the end was always equal to or at most 1 character more (if number of characters to pad with was odd) than the number of padding characters up front.
