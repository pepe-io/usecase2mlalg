{"title": "Shaking Earth", "description": "What is this competition all about? Given seismic signals we are asked to predict the time until the onset of laboratory earthquakes. The training data is a single sequence of signal and seems to come from one experiment alone. In contrast the test data consists of several different sequences, called segments, that may correspond to different experiments. The regular pattern we might find in the train set does not match those of the test segments.  For each test data segment with its corresponding seg_id we are asked to predict it's single time until the lab earthquake takes place.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/allunia/shaking-earth", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-02-04 09:11:02", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:01:16", "words": 99, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Physics", "description_category_score": 0.42697665095329285, "description_category_runtime": 8.637, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6333460211753845, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.917, "category": "Physics", "category_score": 0.42697665095329285, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6333460211753845, "runtime_cat": 21.554, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.803", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999973227953287", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "competition given seismic signal asked predict time onset laboratory earthquake training data single sequence signal seems come one experiment alone contrast test data consists several different sequence called segment may correspond different experiment regular pattern might find train set match test segment test data segment corresponding seg_id asked predict single time lab earthquake take place", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
