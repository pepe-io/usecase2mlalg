Key Recommendations   1. What is Diversity HiringA Gentle Introduction to Diversity Hiring\"Diversity is the collective strength of any successful organization\". Diversity hiring is the hiring process that is free from bias based on age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other personal characteristics. Diversity is very crutial for any company as it leads to creation of a culture that enables new ways of thinking, gives them an edge versus their competitors, and in turn, impacts the bottom line and overall success of the company (Source: Forbes). However, Many companies struggle to ensure high levels of diversity among the employees and even the potential applicants for the open positions. In some cases, this is the due to explicit nature of companies to give less importance to diversity. But in large number of cases, it is due to the implicit Unconscious bias among different elements of the company such as hiring manager's mindset, company's actions, and even the job bulletins for the open positions. Unconscious Bias : What it it, Why it occurs? Unconscious bias is the set of assumptions directly linked to one's thinking, judgements, social background, personal values, etc. is often defined as prejudice or unsupported judgments in favor of or against one thing, person, or group as compared to another, in a way that is usually considered unfair. Most common example of Unconscious bias is the gender bias which exists in different cycles of hiring process. (Source: Empiric) Unconscious Bias in Job BulletinsResearch shows that use of masculine language in bulletins such as including adjectives like \u201ccompetitive\u201d and \u201cdetermined,\u201d results in women\u2019s \u201cperceiving that they would not belong in the work environment.\u201d On the other hand, use of words like \u201ccollaborative\u201d and \u201ccooperative\u201d tend to draw more women than men. Use of language and word choice plays a key role in encourgaing applicant's diversity. Thus, it is important for the company to write job bulletins which are gendered-neutral or are free of any Unconscious bias. In this kernel, I have performed different types of analysis which measure, quantify and analyse the Unconscious bias - specifically gender bias.  2. Unconscious Gender Bias in City of LA's Job Bulletins ? Job bulletins biased toward a specific gender can limit the candidate pool and diversity.  Following are some of the common traits of a gendered bias job bulletin.  1. High Use of Genderded Keywords: Words which are more \u2018aggressive\u2019, \u2018assertive\u2019 or \u2018independent\u2019 rather than things \u2018conscientious\u2019, \u2018dedicated\u2019 and \u2018sociable\u2019 will typically put off women. Using gender-charged words in job description can isolate a gender from applying 2. High Use of Superlatives Usage: Excessive use of superlatives such as \u201cexpert,\u201d \u201csuperior,\u201d \u201cworld class\u201d can turn off female candidates who are more collaborative than competitive in nature    3. Less Use of Relationship/Family Keywords Usage: Descriptions in which there is more usage of family oriented keywords tend to attract more female than men.  4. Very Demanding Requirements: Research shows that women are unlikely to apply for a position unless they meet 100 percent of the requirements, while men will apply if they meet 60 percent of the requirements.   5. Use of Gendered pronouns: Using pronouns which are targeted for particular gender is not considered a good style of writing.   6. Use of Keywords containing \"man\": Keywords containing \"man\" may sound that they are only meant for males.     I used following sources to obtain all the relevant information related to unconscious bias in job bulletins. Sources: OnGig, LinkedIn, HarvardBusinessSchool, Lever, SHRM, Catalyst, SheGeeksOut, Katmatfield, ZipRecruiter, BBC, Textio In the following cell I have developed different functions that analyse these traits in the job bulletins. I curated several lists from multiple sources and complied them for different categories - masculine denotation, feminine denotation, superlatives, relationships etc. Following word clouds shows the top keywords related to feminine and masculine category.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/2-encourage-diversity-reduce-bias-cola", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["nltk", "spacy"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-06-20 16:06:41", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:42:37", "words": 1105, "sentences": 45, "sum_nltk": "Data Science For Good : CoLA A Complete Pipeline for Structuring, Analysis and Recommendation Improve Hiring Process and Decisions  Key Objectives: Keeping these challenges in mind, an ideal solution for the City of Los Angeles has following key objectives: Develop an nlp framework to accurately structurize the job descriptions.\nThis kernel uses bag of words, dictionary approch to check the presence of certain category of keywords in the text, it then applies different normalization techniques in order to quantify the amount of unconscious bias present in the text.\n2.
