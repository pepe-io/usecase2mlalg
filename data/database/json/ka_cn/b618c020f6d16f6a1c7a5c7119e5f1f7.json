{"title": "Teaching notebook for total imaging newbies", "description": "This kernel will implement classical image techniques and will hopefully serve as a useful primer to people who have never worked with image data before. Ultimately, we will develop a simple pipeline using scipy and numpy (and a little bit of scikit-image) that we can apply to the test images -- in fact, we won't even use the training images except to optimize parameters. I'll keep updating this notebook to try and improve it - user Gabro Vecsei takes a similar approach and scores 0.22 in this kernel. My main intention here, though, is to help out people who are new to analyses, not to score highly.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/stkbailey/teaching-notebook-for-total-imaging-newbies", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-02-01 22:40:10", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:38:53", "words": 107, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.19687940180301666, "description_category_runtime": 9.772, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.45179831981658936, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.856, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.19687940180301666, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.45179831981658936, "runtime_cat": 24.628, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.794", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999976430439752", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel implement classical image technique hopefully serve useful primer people never worked image data ultimately develop simple pipeline using scipy numpy little bit scikitimage apply test image fact wont even use training image except optimize parameter ill keep updating notebook try improve user gabro vecsei take similar approach score 022 kernel main intention though help people new analysis score highly", "tags_descriptive": []}
