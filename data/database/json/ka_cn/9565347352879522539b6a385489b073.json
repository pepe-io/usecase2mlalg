{"title": "Keras Starter Script with Word Embeddings", "description": "This script intends to be a starter script for Keras using pre-trained word embeddings. Word embedding: Word embedding is the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. They are also called as word vectors. Two commonly used word embeddings are:  Google word2vec Stanford Glove  In this notebook, we will use the GloVe word vector which is downloaded from this link Let us first import the necessary packages.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/keras-starter-script-with-word-embeddings", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "vocabulary"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-03-18 04:40:08", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:22:58", "words": 93, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.17551355063915253, "description_category_runtime": 8.885, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2810455560684204, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.403, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.17551355063915253, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.2810455560684204, "runtime_cat": 22.288, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.74", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968013712988", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "script intends starter script kera using pretrained word embeddings word embedding word embedding collective name set language modeling feature learning technique natural language processing nlp word phrase vocabulary mapped vector real number also called word vector two commonly used word embeddings google word2vec stanford glove notebook use glove word vector downloaded link let u first import necessary package", "tags_descriptive": []}
