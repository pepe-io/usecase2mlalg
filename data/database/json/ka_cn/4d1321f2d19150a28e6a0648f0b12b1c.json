{"title": "Home Court Advantage- Weighted 4 Factors ", "description": "Introduction: One notable difference between the men's and women's March Madness tournament is that the top 16 seeds in the women\u2019s tournament will host 3 other teams for rounds 1 and 2. In other words, seeds 1-4 in every region will be guaranteed a home game for round 1, and if they win, round 2 will also be a home game. The goal of this Kernel is to show how important it is to account for these home games in your model. Some of the ideas for this kernal were inspired by this article and it is worth a read: https://audacityofhoops.blogspot.com/2010/04/opponent-adjusted-four-factors.html Step 1: Build a simple model with raw un-weighted 4 Factor Stats.Predict on 2018 Data and get a baseline log loss. Step 2: Weight the 4 factor stats when a team is playing a home game. Rerun the model, and compare the log loss scores.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mattjburrill/home-court-advantage-weighted-4-factors", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-05-15 17:00:24", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:28:45", "words": 146, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.10401083528995514, "description_category_runtime": 13.796, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2963346838951111, "description_subcategory_runtime": 22.384, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.10401083528995514, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.2963346838951111, "runtime_cat": 36.182, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.55", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972023999596", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introduction one notable difference men woman march madness tournament top 16 seed woman tournament host 3 team round 1 2 word seed 14 every region guaranteed home game round 1 win round 2 also home game goal kernel show important account home game model idea kernal inspired article worth read httpsaudacityofhoopsblogspotcom201004opponentadjustedfourfactorshtml step 1 build simple model raw unweighted 4 factor statspredict 2018 data get baseline log loss step 2 weight 4 factor stats team playing home game rerun model compare log loss score", "tags_descriptive": []}
