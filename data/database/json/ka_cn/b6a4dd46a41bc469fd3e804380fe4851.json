{"title": "Cifar10 high accuracy model build on PyTorch", "description": "In this notebook I am using the Cifar10 dataset to classify various images.  I have coded the traditional LeNet model with some hyper parameter tuning for this purpose. As seen I got 71% accuracy for this model and te model performed well on images it had never seen before. It correctly classified a random image from the internet.
