{"title": "\u269b\ufe0f Exploring Molecular Properties Data", "description": "Predicting Molecular PropertiesCan you measure the magnetic interactions between a pair of atoms? In this competition, you will develop an algorithm that can predict the magnetic interaction between two atoms in a molecule (i.e., the scalar coupling constant).  NOTE : Some (but not all) of the text in this kernel was taken from the competition details. I do this to show exactly what the description and rules are for the competition alongside some exploritory code.
