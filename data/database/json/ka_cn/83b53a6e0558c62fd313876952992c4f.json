{"title": "Feature Importance v1", "description": "Feature importanceI will explore the importance of the features using Univariate. Plan of attck is as follows:  Reduce training data set down to last month only (i.e. May 2016) Clean data Split up the 24 products and compute feature importance for each product Summarise findings  This is my first attempt to compute feature importance, any comments and suggestions are welcome. If you find this notebook useful, I shall be grateful for any upvote :)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/marc000/feature-importance-v1", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-11-29 19:36:52", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:13:05", "words": 76, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.01, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.3191380798816681, "description_category_runtime": 7.183, "description_subcategory": "Rental & Leasing", "description_subcategory_score": 0.3274480402469635, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.173, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.3191380798816681, "subcategory": "Rental & Leasing", "subcategory_score": 0.3274480402469635, "runtime_cat": 18.357, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.7", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999960522867386", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "feature importancei explore importance feature using univariate plan attck follows reduce training data set last month ie may 2016 clean data split 24 product compute feature importance product summarise finding first attempt compute feature importance comment suggestion welcome find notebook useful shall grateful upvote", "tags_descriptive": []}
