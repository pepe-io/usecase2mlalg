{"title": "ELI5 for Mercari", "description": "ELI5: which features are important for price predictionOr, explain like I'm 5, how does a linear ridge predict prices? ElL5 is a library that can help us with that, let's see it in action. It has support for many models, including XGBoost and LightGBM, but we'll be using it to analyze the Ridge model from scikit-learn.  Overall modelling strategy is inspired by this beatiful kernel Ridge Script by Alexandru Papiu.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/lopuhin/eli5-for-mercari", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-17 20:51:48", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:05:42", "words": 71, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.3109002411365509, "description_category_runtime": 7.901, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7749937772750854, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.32, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.3109002411365509, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7749937772750854, "runtime_cat": 20.222, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.795", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999962983260678", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "eli5 feature important price predictionor explain like im 5 linear ridge predict price ell5 library help u let see action support many model including xgboost lightgbm well using analyze ridge model scikitlearn overall modelling strategy inspired beatiful kernel ridge script alexandru papiu", "tags_descriptive": []}
