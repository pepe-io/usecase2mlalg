{"title": "Reinforcement Learning meets Halite", "description": "The purpose of this notebook is to answer some questions about how to approach making an RL Agent for Halite. An important note: great results have not been reached with this design, but this is mainly due to short training times, untuned hyperparameters, and a sparse reward system. The design that we will be looking at contains three parts: an agent, an agent helper, and an environment.   *Simulated Environment does not necessarily provide the reward", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tiger37/reinforcement-learning-meets-halite", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-22 18:53:08", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:40:17", "words": 77, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.08854439854621887, "description_category_runtime": 7.289, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.19054624438285828, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.549, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.08854439854621887, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.19054624438285828, "runtime_cat": 18.838, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.706", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999973740173012", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "purpose notebook answer question approach making rl agent halite important note great result reached design mainly due short training time untuned hyperparameters sparse reward system design looking contains three part agent agent helper environment simulated environment necessarily provide reward", "tags_descriptive": []}
