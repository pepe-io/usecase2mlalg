{"title": "Transfer learning (VGG-19, ResNet-50) with KFold", "description": "Introduction This is a very basic implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) using pretrained models VGG-19 and ResNet-50. Fully implemented using keras. You can learn following things by reading this.  Keras implementation of a CNN using VGG-19. Keras implementation of a CNN using ResNet-50. Train only the fully connected layers after above 2 models. Train last few layers of the above 2 models along with fully connected layers. StratidiedKFold evaluation. Utility funcitons required when working with images.
