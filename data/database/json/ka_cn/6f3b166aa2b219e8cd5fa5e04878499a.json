ToDo:  Experiment with news resampling on different periods - 10 days. Now many market rows have empty news joined Train on random time windows instead of sampling single records. Try technical indicators on market data: MACD, RSI etc.  Work with residuals instead of raw data", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/dmitrypukhov/eda-and-lstm-with-generator-for-market-and-news", "tags": ["Finance", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "LSTM"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "xgboost", "tensorflow", "sklearn", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-20 04:32:43", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:02:27", "words": 99, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.3987550437450409, "description_category_runtime": 19.788, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9710543155670166, "description_subcategory_runtime": 31.953, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.3987550437450409, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9710543155670166, "runtime_cat": 51.741, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.753", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999985216854743", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "1 introductionmain idea use lstm neural network predict stock movement code version kernel github httpsgithubcomdmitrypukhovmarketnewslstm used idea sometimes copy pasted code kernel eda outlier httpswwwkagglecomartgoredafeatureengineeringandeverything nn httpswwwkagglecomchristofhenkelmarketdatannbaseline lstm httpswwwkagglecompablocastilla httpswwwkagglecomsergeykalutskylstmmodelonmarketdata httpswwwkagglecomashkaanlstmbaseline news processing httpswwwkagglecombguberfainasimplemodelusingthemarketandnewsdata disclaimer currently model performance perfect todo experiment news resampling different period 10 day many market row empty news joined train random time window instead sampling single record try technical indicator market data macd rsi etc work residual instead raw data", "tags_descriptive": ["Finance", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Long short-term memory (LSTM)"]}
