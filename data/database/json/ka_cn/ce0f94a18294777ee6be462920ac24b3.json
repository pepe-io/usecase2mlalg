{"title": "Predict NCAA Basketball 2018", "description": "Predict NCAA Basketball 2018 Here we will use Logistic Regression to predict the outcomes of every possible matchup in the 2018 March Madness basketball tournament.  Our classifier will make its decision based off of the values for 17 features.  One important feature is a ranking metric called ELO (Link #1, Link #2) while the remaining 16 features are traditional basketball metrics (described below).  Note that many functions are adapted from this solution from 2016.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-ncaa-basketball-2018", "tags": ["Sports", "Sports"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-04-07 01:52:13", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:48:33", "words": 77, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "description_category_score": 0.0057533374056220055, "description_category_runtime": 7.462, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.20431756973266602, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.204, "category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "category_score": 0.0057533374056220055, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.20431756973266602, "runtime_cat": 18.666, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.683", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999953243453252", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "predict ncaa basketball 2018 use logistic regression predict outcome every possible matchup 2018 march madness basketball tournament classifier make decision based value 17 feature one important feature ranking metric called elo link 1 link 2 remaining 16 feature traditional basketball metric described note many function adapted solution 2016", "tags_descriptive": ["Sports", "Sports"]}
