{"title": "[Inference] EfficientDet", "description": "Inference EfficientDetHi everyone! My name is Alex Shonenkov, I am DL/NLP/CV/TS research engineer. Especially I am in Love with NLP & DL. Recently I have created kernel for this competition about Weighted Boxes Fusion:  WBF approach for ensemble  I hope it is useful for you, my friends! If you didn't read this kernel, don't forget to do it! :) Here I would like to share with you inference part for my training kernel:  [Training] EfficientDet", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/inference-efficientdet", "tags": ["DL"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pytorch", "albumentations"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-28 08:49:27", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:14:55", "words": 78, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.05559336021542549, "description_category_runtime": 8.47, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.36549168825149536, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.777, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.05559336021542549, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.36549168825149536, "runtime_cat": 21.248, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.764", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999979183586458", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "inference efficientdethi everyone name alex shonenkov dlnlpcvts research engineer especially love nlp dl recently created kernel competition weighted box fusion wbf approach ensemble hope useful friend didnt read kernel dont forget would like share inference part training kernel training efficientdet", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)"]}
