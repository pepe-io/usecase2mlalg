In this case specifically I will use ALL the fields on the datasets, but only replace the expiration_date and registration_init_time fields by calculating the difference in days between the two dates. expiration_date\u2212registration_init_time=membership_daysAcknowledgements:This notebook is primarily based on the grate TalySacc's Script. The modifications are mainly for make understanding easier. I also tried to comment the code as much as I could.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/juanumusic/days-instead-of-dates-lgbm-0-66870", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-10-09 20:16:27", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:31:41", "words": 87, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.44595015048980713, "description_category_runtime": 9.234, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7252151966094971, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.152, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.44595015048980713, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.7252151966094971, "runtime_cat": 23.386, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.687", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999966516125784", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "day instead dateson notebook show improve score replacing date data converting number day case specifically use field datasets replace expiration_date registration_init_time field calculating difference day two date expiration_dateregistration_init_timemembership_daysacknowledgementsthis notebook primarily based grate talysaccs script modification mainly make understanding easier also tried comment code much could", "tags_descriptive": []}
