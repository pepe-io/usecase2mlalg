{"title": "Denoising: Autoencoders to the rescue!!", "description": "Hello Kagglers!! This week was totally boring, so in order to cheer up myself, I wanted to put up a new kernel with some cool stuff. I know ..I know...I know autoencoders aren't something new but for some people, they are  a big deal, especially for people new to the field of deep learning. Well, without saying anything further, let's dive in and try to build an autoencoder in Keras.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/aakashnain/denoising-autoencoders-to-the-rescue", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-02-06 18:38:38", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:52:45", "words": 71, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.18355552852153778, "description_category_runtime": 7.415, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2732484042644501, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.54, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.18355552852153778, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.2732484042644501, "runtime_cat": 18.955, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.744", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977203728017", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "hello kagglers week totally boring order cheer wanted put new kernel cool stuff know knowi know autoencoders arent something new people big deal especially people new field deep learning well without saying anything let dive try build autoencoder kera", "tags_descriptive": []}
