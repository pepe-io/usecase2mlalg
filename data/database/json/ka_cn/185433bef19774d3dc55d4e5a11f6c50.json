{"title": "Reading and Organizing Images and Outputs", "description": "The notebook is an extension of the inofficial IO functions. Here we organize the data a bit better for a standard classification / regression problem. The example creates two DataFrames. One for the input (patient ID and all associated files, and header tags) the other for the output (a single vector sized 17 with each position corresponding to one of the 'zones' mentioned in the overview. The value is then between 0 and 1 corresponding with the probability of that zone. This can thus be directly used as an input to a neural network or random forest for training.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/reading-and-organizing-images-and-outputs", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-11-05 22:20:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 15:06:52", "words": 99, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.20204584300518036, "description_category_runtime": 8.911, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.3735698461532593, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.452, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.20204584300518036, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.3735698461532593, "runtime_cat": 22.363, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.726", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999996909754993", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook extension inofficial io function organize data bit better standard classification regression problem example creates two dataframes one input patient id associated file header tag output single vector sized 17 position corresponding one zone mentioned overview value 0 1 corresponding probability zone thus directly used input neural network random forest training", "tags_descriptive": []}
