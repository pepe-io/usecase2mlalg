{"title": "Keras model boosted with plates leak", "description": "As reported by Recursion in this post, there is a special structure in the data which simplifies predictions significantly. Assignments of sirnas to plates is not completely random in this competition. In this kernel, first I show it on the train data, and then apply the leak on the pretrained Keras model (kudos to Alex) with LB 0.113 to get score 0.207. Same model which uses 2 sites for inference gets LB score 0.231 (the original model uses only one site but I just can't hold myself on that).", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/zaharch/keras-model-boosted-with-plates-leak", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-08-06 02:12:45", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:34:09", "words": 89, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.07178056985139847, "description_category_runtime": 8.658, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6533825397491455, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.299, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.07178056985139847, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6533825397491455, "runtime_cat": 21.956, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.736", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999960066750103", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "reported recursion post special structure data simplifies prediction significantly assignment sirnas plate completely random competition kernel first show train data apply leak pretrained kera model kudos alex lb 0113 get score 0207 model us 2 site inference get lb score 0231 original model us one site cant hold", "tags_descriptive": []}
