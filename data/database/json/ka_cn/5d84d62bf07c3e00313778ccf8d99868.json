{"title": "Feature-Based-Starter-TPOT-LB0.559+", "description": "This notebook goes through a simple process of extracting usable columns, append decomposition components to the data set, generating a few basic features, building a model and then make predictions. I am using the TPOT package to create a pipeline. TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.  I thought it is useful to add this to the list of kernels available in this competition.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sheriytm/feature-based-starter-tpot-lb0-559", "tags": ["Model Comparison"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "tpot"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-07-10 04:39:13", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:11:17", "words": 74, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.30431491136550903, "description_category_runtime": 6.872, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9677354097366333, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.626, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.30431491136550903, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9677354097366333, "runtime_cat": 17.499, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.713", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999945308857178", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook go simple process extracting usable column append decomposition component data set generating basic feature building model make prediction using tpot package create pipeline tpot python automated machine learning tool optimizes machine learning pipeline using genetic programming thought useful add list kernel available competition", "tags_descriptive": ["Model Comparison"]}
