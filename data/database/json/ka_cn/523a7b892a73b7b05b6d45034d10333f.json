A bit better accuracy, the threshold wasn't fine-tuned, it was taken from my original resnet18 kernel, so it can get better.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/suicaokhoailang/resnet50-bounding-boxes-0-628-lb", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-13 07:53:38", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 21:28:20", "words": 64, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.26631540060043335, "description_category_runtime": 7.079, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8396939635276794, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.038, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.26631540060043335, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8396939635276794, "runtime_cat": 18.117, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.737", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965305132864", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "wrap take kernel asanakoev combine idea better classification method see really work result better training time since used 68 data 5509s v 8196s bit better accuracy threshold wasnt finetuned taken original resnet18 kernel get better", "tags_descriptive": []}
