The author asked that it took about 20s for him to process each epoc with a GTX1080ti , Kaggle uses at this moment NVIDIA Tesla K80 and it takes about 52 secods per epoch (not too bad) References:  use Keras pre-trained VGG16 acc 98% Building powerful image classification models using very little data Pretrained Keras Models: Symlinked; Not Copied  Dogs vs. Cats Redux Playground Competition, 3rd Place Interview", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/lbronchal/keras-pre-trained-vgg16-kaggle-runnable-version", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-05-24 16:18:01", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:11:50", "words": 159, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.058563388884067535, "description_category_runtime": 15.672, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9508376121520996, "description_subcategory_runtime": 24.39, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.058563388884067535, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9508376121520996, "runtime_cat": 40.063, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.637", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999985127432116", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kera pretrained vgg16 kaggle runnable versionsummarysome time ago come across nice kernel use kera pretrained vgg16 acc 98 author ran code computer possible moment execute kaggle limitation wasnt support gpus wasnt possible use pretrained model wasnt possible download data file nowadays limitation dont exist wanted try done little adaptation mentioned kernel author asked took 20 process epoc gtx1080ti kaggle us moment nvidia tesla k80 take 52 secods per epoch bad reference use kera pretrained vgg16 acc 98 building powerful image classification model using little data pretrained kera model symlinked copied dog v cat redux playground competition 3rd place interview", "tags_descriptive": []}
