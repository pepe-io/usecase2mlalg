Contains 785 unique display sizes. These can be used together withCensus_ChassisTypeName to differentiate the devices further.  Census_InternalPrimaryDisplayResolutionHorizontal - Retrieves the number of pixels in the horizontal direction of the internal display. 2,180 unique values are present. Most popular ones are 1,366 and 1,920 resolution. These values might indicate the age of the device. Higher resolutions most likely mean that the devices are relatively new, compared to the rest. This hypothesis would also be affected by Census_InternalPrimaryDiagonalDisplaySizeInInches. Most likely, larger displays will have higher resolution.  Census_InternalPrimaryDisplayResolutionVertical - Retrieves the number of pixels in the vertical direction of the internal display. 1,560 unique values.  Census_PowerPlatformRoleName - Indicates the OEM preferred power management profile. This value helps identify the basic form factor of the device  Census_InternalBatteryType - NA. Has a lot of inconsistent naming schemes.  For example - '#', 'lion', '4cel', 'l\u0006&#TAB#'. Majority of the machines are still represented in less than 10 labels. Some of these seem similar, for example - lion, li-i and liio could possibly be placeholders for lithium-ion batteries.  Census_InternalBatteryNumberOfCharges - Assuming this to be the number of battery cycles. If battery cycles are set to zero, could it be that these devices were in the first cycle of battery charge / are VMs or desktops ? What makes it more interesting is that 56% of the machines are in their first cycle of battery charge OR are non-battery operated.  Census_OSVersion - Numeric OS version Example - 10.0.10130.0.

Mostly available to large enterprises and govt institutions and comes with premium support. GLVK also needs a KMS (key management service) for deployment.source  KMS Client and Volume MAK product keys, are volume license keys that are not-for-resale.  They are issued by organizations for use on client computers associated in some way with the organization.  Volume license keys may not be transferred with the computer if the computer changes ownership.  OEM SLP and COA SLP product keys, are issued by large computer manufacturers and use SLP (System Locked Pre-installation) technology to bind the license to the original motherboard via the BIOS and software. The OEM SLP keys self-activate if the corresponding data in the BIOS is correct.  OEM SLP keys, which the user can read in the MGADiag report or software like KeyFinder, cannot be used by the end user to manually activate Windows.  The COA SLP key is printed on a sticker affixed to the side of the computer case (desktops), or on the bottom of the case (laptops), or in the battery compartment (newer laptops).  This is the key for the user to enter manually should he need to activate Windows himself.  OEM System Builder**, product keys are for use by smaller system builders, computer shops, consultants, and others who provide computers and services to their customers.  A system builder is defined by the System Builder license as \"an original equipment manufacturer, an assembler, a refurbisher, or a software pre-installer that sells the Customer System(s) to a third party.\"  Retail, product keys are what the customer gets when he buys a Full Packaged Product (FPP), commonly known as a \"boxed copy\", of Windows from a retail merchant or purchases Windows online from the Microsoft Store.  OEM NON-SLP then means license keys from an OEM but not bound to a System Locked Pre-installation. OEM keys are not-for-resale and may not be transferred to another computer.  They may, however, be transferred with the computer if the computer is transferred to new ownership.   \u200b         Source  Census_IsFlightingInternal - 'Flighting' in Windows Defender context means making new development features available as soon as possible, during the development cycle.
