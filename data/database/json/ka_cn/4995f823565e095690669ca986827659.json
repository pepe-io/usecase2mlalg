{"title": "CNN Cat and Dog Classification", "description": "This is another well known dataset to do hands on Image Classification  using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).CNN as a subset of Deep Learning uses Convolution instead of linear matrix operation. Convolution is a mathematical operation between 2 functions f(x) and g(x) expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other as f o g(x).Import the libraries.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/subhamoybhaduri/cnn-cat-and-dog-classification", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-31 09:21:36", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:56:58", "words": 59, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.07715632766485214, "description_category_runtime": 6.543, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9055709838867188, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.788, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.07715632766485214, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9055709838867188, "runtime_cat": 16.33, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.633", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999966754981623", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "another well known dataset hand image classification using convolutional neural network cnncnn subset deep learning us convolution instead linear matrix operation convolution mathematical operation 2 function fx gx expressing shape one modified f gximport library", "tags_descriptive": []}
