ResnetNote: I am not going to train model on longer epochs my solely aim is to illustrate how different architectures works.If you want to get better accuracy and performance of the model please make deeper models and run for many epochs and tune the hyperparameters and also i commented some code blocks as they are taking longer time to run if you want to run them uncomment them.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/ratan123/in-depth-guide-to-different-cnn-architectures", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-07-03 15:52:50", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:10:46", "words": 95, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.26453807950019836, "description_category_runtime": 9.603, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8338788747787476, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.047, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.26453807950019836, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8338788747787476, "runtime_cat": 24.65, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.688", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999994805992107", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "guide different cnn architecture using kerasin tutorial going explain 5 different cnn architecture commonly used1 vgg16192 googlenetinception3 xception4 mobile net5 resnetnote going train model longer epoch solely aim illustrate different architecture worksif want get better accuracy performance model please make deeper model run many epoch tune hyperparameters also commented code block taking longer time run want run uncomment", "tags_descriptive": []}
