{"title": "Variables shifting distributions in time", "description": "This notebook is dedicated to visualizing variables distribution shift in time. Distribution shift is measured with correlation between overall ant timestamp distribution of each variable. I hope this might be useful for someone, as it is clear that distribution of variables change in time. Some timestamp outliers in training dataset can be seen as well.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/raddar/variables-shifting-distributions-in-time", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-12-27 13:42:36", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:01:01", "words": 55, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.24381598830223083, "description_category_runtime": 5.451, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.303486168384552, "description_subcategory_runtime": 8.251, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.24381598830223083, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.303486168384552, "runtime_cat": 13.703, "programming_language": "R notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.724", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999969578953358", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook dedicated visualizing variable distribution shift time distribution shift measured correlation overall ant timestamp distribution variable hope might useful someone clear distribution variable change time timestamp outlier training dataset seen well", "tags_descriptive": []}
