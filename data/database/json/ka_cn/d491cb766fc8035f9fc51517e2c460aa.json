{"title": "[PANDA] Optimized tiling (+ tf.data.Dataset)", "description": "Algorithm to compute \"optimal\" coordinates for patches/tilesSorry if the code is messy and/or unreadable! But I tried to document/comment here and there to make it a bit clearer. Also, the algorithm is not optimized in terms of run-time (it's rather slow actually), but aims to optimize the coordinates of the patches/tiles.
