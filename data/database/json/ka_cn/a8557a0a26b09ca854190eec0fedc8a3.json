{"title": "Fork of Combining CNN and RNN", "description": "This model combines two branches: MobileNet and Bidirectional LSTM.The Mobilenet branch is largely based on Beluga's kernel https://www.kaggle.com/gaborfodor/greyscale-mobilenet-lb-0-892 and the LSTM branch is inspired by Kevin's kernel, with modifications https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/quickdraw-baseline-lstm-reading-and-submission The performance depends on what you use for the two branches. I got up to 0.925 using this architecture.
