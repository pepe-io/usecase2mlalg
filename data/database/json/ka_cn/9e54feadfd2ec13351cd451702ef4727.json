{"title": "Kuzushiji Recognition Complete Guide", "description": "Kuzushiji Recognition Complete GuideBuild a model to transcribe ancient Kuzushiji into contemporary Japanese characters   Imagine the history contained in a thousand years of books. What stories are in those books? What knowledge can we learn from the world before our time? What was the weather like 500 years ago? What happened when Mt. Fuji erupted? How can one fold 100 cranes using only one piece of paper? The answers to these questions are in those books. Japan has millions of books and over a billion historical documents such as personal letters or diaries preserved nationwide. Most of them cannot be read by the majority of Japanese people living today because they were written in \u201cKuzushiji\u201d. Even though Kuzushiji, a cursive writing style, had been used in Japan for over a thousand years, there are very few fluent readers of Kuzushiji today (only 0.01% of modern Japanese natives). Due to the lack of available human resources, there has been a great deal of interest in using Machine Learning to automatically recognize these historical texts and transcribe them into modern Japanese characters. kernel completed!
