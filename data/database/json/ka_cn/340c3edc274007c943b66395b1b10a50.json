{"title": "Starter Devkit Lyft3D", "description": "Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles   Self-driving technology presents a rare opportunity to improve the quality of life in many of our communities. Avoidable collisions, single-occupant commuters, and vehicle emissions are choking cities, while infrastructure strains under rapid urban growth. Autonomous vehicles are expected to redefine transportation and unlock a myriad of societal, environmental, and economic benefits. You can apply your data analysis skills in this competition to advance the state of self-driving technology.  This dataset aims to democratize access to such data, and foster innovation in higher-level autonomy functions for everyone, everywhere. By conducting a competition, we hope to encourage the research community to focus on hard problems in this space\u2014namely, 3D object detection over semantic maps. In this competition, you will build and optimize algorithms based on a large-scale dataset. This dataset features the raw sensor camera inputs as perceived by a fleet of multiple, high-end, autonomous vehicles in a restricted geographic area.
