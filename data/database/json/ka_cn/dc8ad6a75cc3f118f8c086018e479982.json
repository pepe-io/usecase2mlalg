{"title": "Unsupervised Text Selection", "description": "TensorFlow roBERTa - Unsupervised Text SelectionWow, this notebook does not use selected_text. This notebook only uses the columns text and sentiment. We train a roBERTa model to predict sentiment (pos, neg, neu) from Tweet text achieving 80% accuracy. We then display what part of the text was influencial in deciding whether the text was postive, negative, or neutral. This is unsupervised learning because we are learning the selected_text without using the selected_text. This unsupervised DL notebook is inspired by Nick's awesome unsupervised ML notebook here and it's similar to my previous unsupervised DL notebook for image recognition here", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/unsupervised-text-selection", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-04-13 19:59:49", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:53:52", "words": 98, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Media & Publishing", "description_category_score": 0.2363702952861786, "description_category_runtime": 10.487, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.989325761795044, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.935, "category": "Media & Publishing", "category_score": 0.2363702952861786, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.989325761795044, "runtime_cat": 26.421, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.707", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999967908900782", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "tensorflow roberta unsupervised text selectionwow notebook use selected_text notebook us column text sentiment train roberta model predict sentiment po neg neu tweet text achieving 80 accuracy display part text influencial deciding whether text postive negative neutral unsupervised learning learning selected_text without using selected_text unsupervised dl notebook inspired nick awesome unsupervised ml notebook similar previous unsupervised dl notebook image recognition", "tags_descriptive": []}
