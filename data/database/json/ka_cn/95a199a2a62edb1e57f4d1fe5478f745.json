{"title": "NYC Taxi Fare Starter Kernel - Simple Linear Model", "description": "This is a basic Starter Kernel for the New York City Taxi Fare Prediction Playground CompetitionHere we'll use a simple linear model based on the travel vector from the taxi's pickup location to dropoff location which predicts the fare_amount of each ride. This kernel uses some pandas and mostly numpy for the critical work.  There are many higher-level libraries you could use instead, for example sklearn or statsmodels.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/dster/nyc-taxi-fare-starter-kernel-simple-linear-model", "tags": ["Linear Regression"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "statsmodels"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-07-25 04:04:04", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:20:01", "words": 69, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.01713491603732109, "description_category_runtime": 6.953, "description_subcategory": "Transportation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.922583281993866, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.692, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.01713491603732109, "subcategory": "Transportation", "subcategory_score": 0.922583281993866, "runtime_cat": 17.644, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.797", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999959051965074", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "basic starter kernel new york city taxi fare prediction playground competitionhere well use simple linear model based travel vector taxi pickup location dropoff location predicts fare_amount ride kernel us panda mostly numpy critical work many higherlevel library could use instead example sklearn statsmodels", "tags_descriptive": ["Linear Regression"]}
