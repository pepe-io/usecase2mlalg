{"title": "CNN for Digit Recognition in the Kannada script ", "description": "Kannada MNIST CNNKannada is a language spoken predominantly by people of Karnataka in southwestern India. The language has roughly 45 million native speakers and is written using the Kannada script. The goal of this competition is to use Machine Learning to correctly label hand-written digits written in the Kannada script. The Kannada dataset format is based on the dataset used in the original MNIST dataset where the objective was the same but the hand-written digits were in Arabic numerals.
