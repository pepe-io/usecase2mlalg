{"title": "A look at russian kagglers over time", "description": "Kaggle ML & DS SurveyEvery year we have a Machine Learning and Data Science Survey from Kaggle. Well, this is the third time :) In this kernel I wanted to do some analysis which would be interesting to me and so I have decided to have a look at the russian kagglers (as I'm russian myself). I'll show how our characteristics changed (or not changed) over time and what is interesting about us. Let's assume that the survery is representative and allows to make conclusions. For some features it is possible to compare data in different years, but for others either there is no such data or the data is in very different formats.
