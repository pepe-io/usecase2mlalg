{"title": "InceptionV3 with sliding window image breakdown", "description": "Sliding window source image breakdownThe input images are fairly large. Certainly larger then will fit into GPU memory with any modern image processing NN. One obvious way to solve that problem is to resize them. However, that loses a lot of information. One interesting feature of these images though, is that they contain lot of similar elements (multiple cells per image). That means, if we cut them into pieces, we will still have lot of relevant info. This notebook slices each 512x512 image into 4 299x299 images and feeds them to InceptionV3 network. This results in decent improvement at the expence of multiplying training time by 4.**", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/iluxave/inceptionv3-with-sliding-window-image-breakdown", "tags": ["DL", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-10-26 22:12:09", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 21:26:51", "words": 107, "sentences": 8, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.12869125604629517, "description_category_runtime": 9.803, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5627654194831848, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.121, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.12869125604629517, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.5627654194831848, "runtime_cat": 24.925, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.702", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999963018086107", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "sliding window source image breakdownthe input image fairly large certainly larger fit gpu memory modern image processing nn one obvious way solve problem resize however loses lot information one interesting feature image though contain lot similar element multiple cell per image mean cut piece still lot relevant info notebook slice 512x512 image 4 299x299 image feed inceptionv3 network result decent improvement expence multiplying training time 4", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Classification"]}
