{"title": "Black&White CNN [LB=0.77]", "description": "Keras Simple CNN BenchmarkI assume you are already familiar with the competition dataset. This benchmark helps you to reach 0.77 MAP@3. This kernel has three main components:  Simple configurable Convolutional Network Fast and memory efficient Image Generator Full training & submission with Kaggle Kernel  I did some paramer search but it should not be hard to improve the current score. Simplified versions could be trained without GPU.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/gaborfodor/black-white-cnn-lb-0-77", "tags": ["DL", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-10-20 18:50:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:18:48", "words": 69, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.04208534210920334, "description_category_runtime": 7.082, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9283294081687927, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.92, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.04208534210920334, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9283294081687927, "runtime_cat": 18.002, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.715", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999959070341506", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kera simple cnn benchmarki assume already familiar competition dataset benchmark help reach 077 map3 kernel three main component simple configurable convolutional network fast memory efficient image generator full training submission kaggle kernel paramer search hard improve current score simplified version could trained without gpu", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Classification"]}
