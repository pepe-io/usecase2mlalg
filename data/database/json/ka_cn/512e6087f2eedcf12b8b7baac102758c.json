{"title": "A validation framework & impact of the random seed", "description": "There have been some issues regarding the correlation between CV and leaderboard scores in this competition. Every top-scoring public kernel has a much lower CV score than leaderboard score. It has also been very frustrating to tune a model to optimal CV score only to discover that the score on the Leaderboard is abysmal. In this kernel I am going to address this issue and propose a framework for robust local validation. The preprocessing and model architecture have stayed mostly the same as in my previous kernel. I'll also write about the impact of seeds on the score. Again, we'll start with standard imports.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/bminixhofer/a-validation-framework-impact-of-the-random-seed", "tags": ["DL"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-16 11:35:16", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:20:43", "words": 104, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Manufacturing", "description_category_score": 0.16244709491729736, "description_category_runtime": 9.123, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.48028233647346497, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.996, "category": "Manufacturing", "category_score": 0.16244709491729736, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.48028233647346497, "runtime_cat": 23.119, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.741", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999961956036088", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "issue regarding correlation cv leaderboard score competition every topscoring public kernel much lower cv score leaderboard score also frustrating tune model optimal cv score discover score leaderboard abysmal kernel going address issue propose framework robust local validation preprocessing model architecture stayed mostly previous kernel ill also write impact seed score well start standard import", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)"]}
