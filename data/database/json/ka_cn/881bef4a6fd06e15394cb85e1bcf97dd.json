{"title": "Ensembling Algorithm for Average Precision Metric", "description": "Ensembling can be a valuable tool for combining the insights of many different machine learning models.  Given the nature of this problem (rank the 5 most likely), a different ensembling algorithm than mere averaging must be used.  Here, I employ an ensembling algorithm that was recently very successful in a recent image recognition competition, Quick! Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/matthewa313/ensembling-algorithm-for-average-precision-metric", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-12-18 23:48:03", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 21:28:20", "words": 61, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.006, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.060656167566776276, "description_category_runtime": 6.314, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9387620091438293, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.641, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.060656167566776276, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9387620091438293, "runtime_cat": 15.955, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.707", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999956605648921", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "ensembling valuable tool combining insight many different machine learning model given nature problem rank 5 likely different ensembling algorithm mere averaging must used employ ensembling algorithm recently successful recent image recognition competition quick draw doodle recognition challenge", "tags_descriptive": []}
