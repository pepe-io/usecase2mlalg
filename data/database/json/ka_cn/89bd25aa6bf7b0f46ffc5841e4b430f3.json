{"title": "[PyTorch] BERT Baseline (Public Score ~ 0.54)", "description": "Looks like Matei Ionita beated me to it. Check out his kernel here. I haven't read his kernel carefully yet, but it seems we have basically the same model design. However, his kernel uses Tensorflow and this one uses PyTorch. Since Matei Ionita alread did a great job explaining the workflow, I won't repeat the same thing here. I'll just let the code do the speaking and comment when necessary.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/ceshine/pytorch-bert-baseline-public-score-0-54", "tags": ["NLP"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-24 06:16:09", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:09:27", "words": 70, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Construction & Engineering", "description_category_score": 0.2940312922000885, "description_category_runtime": 7.345, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.779299259185791, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.341, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.2940312922000885, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.779299259185791, "runtime_cat": 18.686, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.718", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999938622232902", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "look like matei ionita beated check kernel havent read kernel carefully yet seems basically model design however kernel us tensorflow one us pytorch since matei ionita alread great job explaining workflow wont repeat thing ill let code speaking comment necessary", "tags_descriptive": ["Natural Language Processing (NLP)"]}
