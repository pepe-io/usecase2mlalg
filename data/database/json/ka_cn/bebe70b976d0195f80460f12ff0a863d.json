{"title": "Simple Fourier Analysis", "description": "My hope was, that different surface types yield (visible) differences in the frequency spectrum of the sensor measurements. Machine learning techniques might learn frequency filters on their own, but why don't give the machine a little head start? So I computed the the cyclic FFT for the angular velocity and linear acceleration sensors and plotted mean and standard deviation of the absolute values of the frequency components per training surface category (leaving out the frequency 0 (i.e. constants like sensor bias, earth gravity, ...). The sensors show some different frequency characterists (see plots below), but unfortunately the surface categories have all similar (to the human eye) shapes, varying mostly in total power, and the standard deviations are high (compared to differences in the means). So there are no nice strong characteristic peaks for surface types. But that does not mean, that there is nothing detectable by more sophisticated statistical methods. This article http://www.kaggle.com/christoffer/establishing-sampling-frequency makes a convincing case, that the sampling frequency is around 400Hz, so according to that you would see the frequency range to 3-200 Hz in the diagrams (and aliased higher frequencies).", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/trohwer64/simple-fourier-analysis", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-03-22 23:25:29", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:33:04", "words": 184, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.17187951505184174, "description_category_runtime": 16.827, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7210613489151001, "description_subcategory_runtime": 26.404, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.17187951505184174, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7210613489151001, "runtime_cat": 43.233, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.688", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999955759661874", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "hope different surface type yield visible difference frequency spectrum sensor measurement machine learning technique might learn frequency filter dont give machine little head start computed cyclic fft angular velocity linear acceleration sensor plotted mean standard deviation absolute value frequency component per training surface category leaving frequency 0 ie constant like sensor bias earth gravity sensor show different frequency characterists see plot unfortunately surface category similar human eye shape varying mostly total power standard deviation high compared difference mean nice strong characteristic peak surface type mean nothing detectable sophisticated statistical method article httpwwwkagglecomchristofferestablishingsamplingfrequency make convincing case sampling frequency around 400hz according would see frequency range 3200 hz diagram aliased higher frequency", "tags_descriptive": []}
