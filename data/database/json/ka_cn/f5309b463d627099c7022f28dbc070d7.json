{"title": "Creating a metadata DataFrame (fastai)", "description": "It's really handy to have all the DICOM info available in a single DataFrame, so let's create that! In this notebook, we'll just create the DICOM DataFrames. To see how to use them to analyze the competition data, see this followup notebook. First, we'll install the latest versions of pytorch and fastai v2 (not officially released yet) so we can use the fastai medical imaging module.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/creating-a-metadata-dataframe-fastai", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-18 07:57:54", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:47:30", "words": 66, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.23998364806175232, "description_category_runtime": 7.405, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.4414611756801605, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.391, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.23998364806175232, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.4414611756801605, "runtime_cat": 18.796, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.725", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999974917594927", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "really handy dicom info available single dataframe let create notebook well create dicom dataframes see use analyze competition data see followup notebook first well install latest version pytorch fastai v2 officially released yet use fastai medical imaging module", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
