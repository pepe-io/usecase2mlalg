{"title": "Whale Recognition Model with score 0.78563", "description": "Whale Classification ModelThis notebook describes the strategy behind the 0.78563 submission to the Humpack Whale identification Challenge. It should be studied in conjunction with the Bounding Box Model notebook which describes separately the strategy for image cropping. To speed things up, the results of some slow computations are included as a dataset instead of being recomputed here. However, the code is still provided in the notebook as reference, even if it is not executed by default.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/martinpiotte/whale-recognition-model-with-score-0-78563", "tags": ["CNN"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-07-25 17:10:28", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:17:20", "words": 76, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.0035314045380800962, "description_category_runtime": 7.613, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.48733001947402954, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.723, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.0035314045380800962, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.48733001947402954, "runtime_cat": 19.338, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.803", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968614939823", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "whale classification modelthis notebook describes strategy behind 078563 submission humpack whale identification challenge studied conjunction bounding box model notebook describes separately strategy image cropping speed thing result slow computation included dataset instead recomputed however code still provided notebook reference even executed default", "tags_descriptive": ["Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
