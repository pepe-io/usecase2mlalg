{"title": "Load a 3-band TIF image and overlay Dirt Tracks", "description": "This is a quick demonstration of how to load a TIF, display it, and then overlay polygons of one of the feature types, POOR_DIRT_CART_TRACK. I used tifffile to load the image because it's easier to install than GDAL, and the files don't have headers anyway so there's no advantage to GDAL.  I used matplotlib to handle polygons, although I should mention that some of my other code uses openCV for some polygon operations.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/chatcat/load-a-3-band-tif-image-and-overlay-dirt-tracks", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-12-26 20:54:52", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 19:16:58", "words": 74, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Manufacturing", "description_category_score": 0.060211751610040665, "description_category_runtime": 8.317, "description_subcategory": "Restaurant", "description_subcategory_score": 0.05728258937597275, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.831, "category": "Manufacturing", "category_score": 0.060211751610040665, "subcategory": "Restaurant", "subcategory_score": 0.05728258937597275, "runtime_cat": 21.148, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.699", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999982271959553", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "quick demonstration load tif display overlay polygon one feature type poor_dirt_cart_track used tifffile load image easier install gdal file dont header anyway there advantage gdal used matplotlib handle polygon although mention code us opencv polygon operation", "tags_descriptive": []}
