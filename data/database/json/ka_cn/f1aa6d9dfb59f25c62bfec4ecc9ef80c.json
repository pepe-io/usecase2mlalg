{"title": "Shapelets", "description": "Shapelets for time series classificationHello everyone, in this notebook, I would like to show an implementation of shapelet feature extraction. The nice thing about this extraction technique is that it is somewhat interpretable and delivers some insight. Moreover, this technique can be applied on all 1-D series (time-series or converted contours of objects)", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/group16/shapelets", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-11-27 11:29:52", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:03:36", "words": 53, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.01, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.3139433264732361, "description_category_runtime": 6.04, "description_subcategory": "Tools", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6082087755203247, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.126, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.3139433264732361, "subcategory": "Tools", "subcategory_score": 0.6082087755203247, "runtime_cat": 15.165, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.727", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999961121810493", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "shapelets time series classificationhello everyone notebook would like show implementation shapelet feature extraction nice thing extraction technique somewhat interpretable delivers insight moreover technique applied 1d series timeseries converted contour object", "tags_descriptive": []}
