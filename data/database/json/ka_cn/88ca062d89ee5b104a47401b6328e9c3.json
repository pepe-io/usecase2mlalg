{"title": "Stage1 EDA: Microscope image types clustering", "description": "This notebook provides additional information about stage1_train dataset that should help to balance into train/valid for cross-validation. It starts from this interesting thread about image types. Group A are histological slides, group B are fluorescent images, and group C are bright-field images. It can complete this other kernel. It looks we have the following breakdown:  fluorescent: 81.5% histological: 16.1% bright-field: 2.4%", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mpware/stage1-eda-microscope-image-types-clustering", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-01-29 22:37:10", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 18:38:54", "words": 62, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.19739863276481628, "description_category_runtime": 7.706, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.3140021562576294, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.331, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.19739863276481628, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.3140021562576294, "runtime_cat": 19.037, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.74", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999962448546049", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook provides additional information stage1_train dataset help balance trainvalid crossvalidation start interesting thread image type group histological slide group b fluorescent image group c brightfield image complete kernel look following breakdown fluorescent 815 histological 161 brightfield 24", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
