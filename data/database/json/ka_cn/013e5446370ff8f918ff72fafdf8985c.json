{"title": "[For Beginners] Tackling Toxic Using Keras", "description": "This notebook attempts to tackle this classification problem by using Keras LSTM. While there are many notebook out there that are already tackling using this approach, I feel that there isn't enough explanation to what is going on each step. As someone who has been using vanilla Tensorflow, and recently embraced the wonderful world of Keras, I hope to share with fellow beginners the intuition that I gained from my research and study.  Join me as we walk through it.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/sbongo/for-beginners-tackling-toxic-using-keras", "tags": ["NLP", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-01-24 09:43:29", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:20:06", "words": 81, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.31518274545669556, "description_category_runtime": 7.668, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6771590709686279, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.532, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.31518274545669556, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.6771590709686279, "runtime_cat": 19.2, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.801", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975231560398", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "notebook attempt tackle classification problem using kera lstm many notebook already tackling using approach feel isnt enough explanation going step someone using vanilla tensorflow recently embraced wonderful world kera hope share fellow beginner intuition gained research study join walk", "tags_descriptive": ["Natural Language Processing (NLP)", "Classification"]}
