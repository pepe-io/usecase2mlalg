{"title": "Logistic Regression and ROC Curve Primer", "description": "IntroductionThe fact that the Porto Seguro competition is a binary classification task (the customer filed a claim or did not) makes it an excellent opportunity to brush up on two fundamental modelling and evaluation tasks for binary classifiers:  Logistic Regression The ROC curve  Logistic regression is a derivative of linear regression where we are interested in making binary predictions or probability predictions on the interval [0, 1] with a threshold probability to determine where we split between 0 and 1.  The ROC curve or \"receiver operating characteristic\" curve is an evaluation method we can use to assess the efficacy of a binary classification algorithm (\"Receiver Operating Characteristic\", n.d.) as well as choose the optimal threshold based on our tolerance for false negatives and desire for true positives.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/captcalculator/logistic-regression-and-roc-curve-primer", "tags": ["Classification", "Logistic Regression"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["xgboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-08 05:09:38", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 15:44:39", "words": 130, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.010540087707340717, "description_category_runtime": 11.399, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.04526069387793541, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.701, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.010540087707340717, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.04526069387793541, "runtime_cat": 29.1, "programming_language": "R notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.787", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999975511669158", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "introductionthe fact porto seguro competition binary classification task customer filed claim make excellent opportunity brush two fundamental modelling evaluation task binary classifier logistic regression roc curve logistic regression derivative linear regression interested making binary prediction probability prediction interval 0 1 threshold probability determine split 0 1 roc curve receiver operating characteristic curve evaluation method use ass efficacy binary classification algorithm receiver operating characteristic nd well choose optimal threshold based tolerance false negative desire true positive", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Logistic Regression"]}
