{"title": "UNet character detector", "description": "UNet character detectorThis competition has 2 tasks:  detection classification    Here I do only detection. Classification is made further in the same way as MNIST. For this purpose I need to predict not only centers of characters, but also bounding boxes. UNet is utilized here to predict two binary masks: 1) Bounding boxes 2) Centers", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/hocop1/unet-character-detector", "tags": ["DL", "CNN"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-10-06 13:39:51", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:36:30", "words": 58, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Media & Publishing", "description_category_score": 0.08975426107645035, "description_category_runtime": 6.189, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.31693100929260254, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.328, "category": "Media & Publishing", "category_score": 0.08975426107645035, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.31693100929260254, "runtime_cat": 15.516, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.699", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999952856586432", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "unet character detectorthis competition 2 task detection classification detection classification made way mnist purpose need predict center character also bounding box unet utilized predict two binary mask 1 bounding box 2 center", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"]}
