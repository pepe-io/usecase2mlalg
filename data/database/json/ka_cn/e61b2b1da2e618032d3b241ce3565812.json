{"title": "Exploratory Data Analysis + LGBM (Roll Up all sec)", "description": "Happy Thanksgiving day to all, what's on the menu tonight?This kernel is just a baseline for LGB model. No Deep Learning innvolved, LB(0.984) without parameter tuning, No LSTM, No Attention and finally no time factor. I hope this kernel will help you in understanding the data and how easily we can separate the data... Library Used:  -- I used plotly and LGBM the two packages which are widely used in kaggle and it is better to start with this. Exploration includes PCA, TSNE Once again Happy Thanksgiving, Feel free to post your feedback, comments I will take it constructively..", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/karthik7395/exploratory-data-analysis", "tags": ["Classification", "Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-11-22 11:38:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 19:03:18", "words": 100, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.6028092503547668, "description_category_runtime": 10.078, "description_subcategory": "Food", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8270696997642517, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.487, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.6028092503547668, "subcategory": "Food", "subcategory_score": 0.8270696997642517, "runtime_cat": 25.565, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.606", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999961601287577", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "happy thanksgiving day whats menu tonightthis kernel baseline lgb model deep learning innvolved lb0984 without parameter tuning lstm attention finally time factor hope kernel help understanding data easily separate data library used used plotly lgbm two package widely used kaggle better start exploration includes pca tsne happy thanksgiving feel free post feedback comment take constructively", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
