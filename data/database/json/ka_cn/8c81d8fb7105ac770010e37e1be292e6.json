{"title": "Visualizing PCA with Leaf Dataset", "description": "Visualizing PCA with Leaf DatasetIn this script we will apply PCA on leaf images and try to get a feel for the distribution of leaf images using visualizations that (hopefully) clarify different aspects about how to interpret PCA results. We will then continue to see if the PCA features are informative in terms of classifying leafs and determine how many of those we need. I've just updated another script, similar in nature to this one, just focused about k-means. if you enjoyed this one, be sure to also check out the k-means script as well", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/visualizing-pca-with-leaf-dataset", "tags": ["Model Comparison"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-09-22 11:37:18", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:03:36", "words": 95, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.21300892531871796, "description_category_runtime": 9.235, "description_subcategory": "Physical", "description_subcategory_score": 0.5181552767753601, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.12, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.21300892531871796, "subcategory": "Physical", "subcategory_score": 0.5181552767753601, "runtime_cat": 23.355, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.766", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999981898189372", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "visualizing pca leaf datasetin script apply pca leaf image try get feel distribution leaf image using visualization hopefully clarify different aspect interpret pca result continue see pca feature informative term classifying leaf determine many need ive updated another script similar nature one focused kmeans enjoyed one sure also check kmeans script well", "tags_descriptive": ["Model Comparison"]}
