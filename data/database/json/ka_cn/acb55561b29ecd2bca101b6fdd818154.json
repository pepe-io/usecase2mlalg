{"title": "Detectors for Object detection", "description": "Detectors for Object detectionIn this problem, We are asked to do object detection on very large datasets (Open Image V4), here we have 1.7M images and annotations and have 100k images in test set. For doing computation on such a large datasets one will need multiple GPUs. I am listing some of the models that can be used for start working on this problem. The lastest model I am providing link to is of late 2016 and I hope better models are available openly. I will be providing links to following models -  Single Shot Multibox Yolo Faster RCNN", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/maheshdadhich/detectors-for-object-detection", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "py-faster-rcnn", "caffe"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-07-05 17:54:54", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:15:53", "words": 100, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.10087953507900238, "description_category_runtime": 8.876, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9523118734359741, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.664, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.10087953507900238, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9523118734359741, "runtime_cat": 22.539, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.747", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999953062852129", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "detector object detectionin problem asked object detection large datasets open image v4 17m image annotation 100k image test set computation large datasets one need multiple gpus listing model used start working problem lastest model providing link late 2016 hope better model available openly providing link following model single shot multibox yolo faster rcnn", "tags_descriptive": []}
