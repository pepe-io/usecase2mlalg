{"title": "EfficientNetB4 FastAI - Blindness Detection", "description": "EfficientNet architecturePre-trained weights from: https://www.kaggle.com/hmendonca/efficientnet-pytorch-ignite and Ignite examples: Recently new ConvNets architectures have been proposed in \"EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks\" paper. According to the paper, model's compound scaling starting from a 'good' baseline provides an network that achieves state-of-the-art on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet.   This kernel borrowed some of its code from: https://www.kaggle.com/kageyama/fork-of-fastai-blindness-detection-resnet34 and https://www.kaggle.com/demonplus/fast-ai-starter-with-resnet-50 Many thanks to the authors!
