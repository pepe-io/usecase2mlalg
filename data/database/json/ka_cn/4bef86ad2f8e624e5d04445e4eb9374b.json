{"title": "Plants Xception 90.06% Test Accuracy", "description": "Author: Raoul Malm Abstract: Given are 4750 labeled images (1.73GB) showing plants of 12 different types, the goal is to classify correctly the species shown on the 794 images (91MB) of the test set. All images are quadratic but vary in size. We resize them such that each image has the shape (299,299,3). Next, we detect and segment the plant parts of the images, then normalize them such that each pixel is defined on the range [-1,1]. An optional step is to generate new images through rotations, translations and axis flippings, augmenting the original data. All images are then fed into a pretrained Xception model provided by keras and we extract 2048 bottleneck features for each image. Having computed these features once, we train and validate a basic logistic regression, random forest and fully connected neural network model. Finally, we predict the species classes of the test images and write the submission file. Note, that this work demonstrates just a quick and basic implementation and is not fine-tuned. Results:  Using a subset of 200 samples of each species for training and validation with a 90%/10% split, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.33% on the validation set. This takes roughly 30 minutes within the kaggle environment. Using all labeled data for training and making use of little data augmentation, we can obtain an accuracy of 90.06% on the test set. This takes several hours on my average laptop CPU. If you have more computer power you can easily improve these results.
