{"title": "Cipher#3 Solution", "description": "Cipher #3 SolutionTo help kagglers move forward on the cryptanalysis of cipher #3, this kernel wishes to provide material for a known-plaintext attack (KPA) as suggested by EtienneW (https://www.kaggle.com/c/20-newsgroups-ciphertext-challenge/discussion/75407), that is to say matching cipher&plaintext (aka cribs) pairs. We provide the matched cipher&plaintext pairs in output of this kernel in a pickle (df_crib.pkl) And for those who's rather take the elevator than climbing the stairs, this kernel also provides the decryption of cipher #3 train & test sets in pickles (train_3.pkl & test_3.pkl). If you find this material & hints useful, please upvote. Spoiler hint if you are in a hurry: focus only on the alphabetic characters once cipher #2 has been applied to the matching plaintext of a cipher # text (see section 3.1) This kernels proceeds as follows:  It loads and pre-processes all the data for the task at hand: The plain-text set from scikit-learn The competition's train & test set from kaggle The cipher #2 map from another kernel (https://www.kaggle.com/leflal/cipher-1-cipher-2-full-solutions)   It provides several angles to \"understand\" cipher #3: Matching ciphertexts and plaintexts which begin with \"From:\" Matching frequent words across ciphertexts (Subject:, Organization, Lines:) Matching ciphertexts and plaintexts by length of words sequence   It provides the decryption of cipher #3 train & test sets  Hopefully this will help you move past the brick wall.
