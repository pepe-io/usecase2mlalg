{"title": "Deterministic neural networks using PyTorch", "description": "UpdateThere was an issue with the random seed from os.random and the seed when creating the embedding matrix in version 1 - 3. Version 2 got a lucky seed and scored 0.694 for that reason. The problem is fixed since version 4. If you look at the version history you can see that the validation and training loss for version 4 and 5 are exactly the same so it is 100% reproducible now. But it dropped to 0.690 because the seed is less lucky on the Leaderboard. The CV score is even slightly better though.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/bminixhofer/deterministic-neural-networks-using-pytorch", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-02-09 10:20:22", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 16:20:42", "words": 95, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.6258184313774109, "description_category_runtime": 8.622, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.915322482585907, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.111, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.6258184313774109, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.915322482585907, "runtime_cat": 21.733, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.756", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999990300099502", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "updatethere issue random seed osrandom seed creating embedding matrix version 1 3 version 2 got lucky seed scored 0694 reason problem fixed since version 4 look version history see validation training loss version 4 5 exactly 100 reproducible dropped 0690 seed le lucky leaderboard cv score even slightly better though", "tags_descriptive": []}
