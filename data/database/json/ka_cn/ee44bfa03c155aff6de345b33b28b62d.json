{"title": "Google Analytics EDA + LightGBM + Screenshots", "description": "IntroductionKaggle describes this competition as follows: In this competition, you\u2019re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data. For each fullVisitorId in the test set, you must predict the natural log of their total revenue. Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error (RMSE).  This kernel contains an EDA, a Baseline LightGBM model, and also Screenshots of the app. Since I am familiar with Google Analytics and also have the Google Mechandising store setup as a property in my personal environment, I though it would be good to start with some screen shots of the actual application. In the comments, the question was raised \"how I did this\". Well, actually this is pretty easy to setup, and you can find out how to do that through this link: Learn by experimenting with data from the Google Merchandise Store.. However, once I really got started with the EDA, I increasingly found the large screenshots to become a bit distracting and I decided to separate these from the EDA and move them to an Appendix. To go straight to the screenshots: Appendix: Screenshots. Table of contents 1. Loading libraries and data  2.
