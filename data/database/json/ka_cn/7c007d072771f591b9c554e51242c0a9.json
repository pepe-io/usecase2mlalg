{"title": "Decision tree + Smart data augmentation", "description": "In this approach we use Bag of decision trees. Features: Surrouding cells for a given cell. Data Augmentation  Background color is detected using custom logic. Custom logic is written to find the colors which need to be excempted from augmentation. All the colors which are present in all the input of training exmaples are marked for excemption. Color which is not present in input but present in output are excepted.   For rest of colors all permutations are used to augment.  Model Bag of decision trees are used since, single decision tree have some randomness factor which may give incorrect result.
