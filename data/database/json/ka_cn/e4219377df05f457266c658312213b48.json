Example of how to use them in a 3-layer learning architecture. Analysis of the performance of the methods on problems with different number of classes.  Comparison with stack generalization based on LogisticRegression (sklearn implementation) and GradientBoosting (XGBoost implementation).", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/svpons/three-level-classification-architecture", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-03-08 11:38:21", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 16:26:37", "words": 68, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.06706447899341583, "description_category_runtime": 8.079, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.26909586787223816, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.48, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.06706447899341583, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.26909586787223816, "runtime_cat": 20.558, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.768", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999971275960303", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "airbnb new user booking competitionauthor sandro vega pons svponsgmailcom main 3 point notebook source code ensemble technique used solution example use 3layer learning architecture analysis performance method problem different number class comparison stack generalization based logisticregression sklearn implementation gradientboosting xgboost implementation", "tags_descriptive": []}
