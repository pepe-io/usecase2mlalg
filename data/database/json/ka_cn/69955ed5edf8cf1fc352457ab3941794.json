The code is fully commented for you to explore and experiment, and, more important, it will be regularly updated during the competition with furthermore feature creation and more performing neural architectures.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/lucamassaron/categorical-feature-encoding-with-tensorflow", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-01-10 15:26:30", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:42:12", "words": 88, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.01, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.11459743976593018, "description_category_runtime": 12.78, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9921033382415771, "description_subcategory_runtime": 20.004, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.11459743976593018, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9921033382415771, "runtime_cat": 32.785, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.708", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958469178817", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "tensorflow tabular data categorical variablesthis notebook applies tensorflow kera tecniques tabular data described httpsgithubcomlmassarondeep_learning_for_tabular_data httpswwwkagglecomlucamassarondeeplearningfortabulardata presented various meetups google devfests httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnqgut_uadse particular code find different data pipeline drafted binary high cardinality nominal low cardinality nominal ordinal date code fully commented explore experiment important regularly updated competition furthermore feature creation performing neural architecture", "tags_descriptive": []}
