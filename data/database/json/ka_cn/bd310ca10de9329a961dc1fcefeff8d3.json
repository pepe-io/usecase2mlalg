{"title": "Creating Submission From Your Own Model", "description": "There has been a lot of confusion on how exactly we are supposed to submit our model. As the Data section of the competition states: Your model must be named submission.zip and be compatible with TensorFlow 2.2. The submission.zip should contain all files and directories created by the tf.saved_model_save function using Tensorflow's SavedModel format.  Now question is what exactly in the SavedModel format do we need to submit. Also, majority of us don't want to use tensorflow to train our models. And we don't know how to preprocess. So we'll tackle two things mainly.  Use our own keras model in submission. How to preprocess.  Let's get started.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mayukh18/creating-submission-from-your-own-model", "tags": ["DL"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-11 11:24:34", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:53:48", "words": 110, "sentences": 10, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.2640569508075714, "description_category_runtime": 11.116, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8210403323173523, "description_subcategory_runtime": 17.22, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.2640569508075714, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8210403323173523, "runtime_cat": 28.337, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.727", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999951291045426", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "lot confusion exactly supposed submit model data section competition state model must named submissionzip compatible tensorflow 22 submissionzip contain file directory created tfsaved_model_save function using tensorflows savedmodel format question exactly savedmodel format need submit also majority u dont want use tensorflow train model dont know preprocess well tackle two thing mainly use kera model submission preprocess let get started", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)"]}
