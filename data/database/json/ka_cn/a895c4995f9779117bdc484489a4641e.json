{"title": "Feature Extractor & Fine-tuning with Keras", "description": "IntroductionIn this notebook, i will be bringing you through the use of Transfer Learning in pretrained models like VGG16, Resnet etc to solve similar tasks; image classification of Dogs and Cats. We will see how we can use these pretrained models as feature extractors to generate features to be fed into another classifier, as well as finetuning these models to solve our problem. The notebook will be using Keras, a high-level API that allow us to build prototypes quickly with minimum coding, without loss in performance.
