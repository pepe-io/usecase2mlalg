{"title": "Lyft - Ensembling Raster Sizes", "description": "Raster Size EnsemblingThis notebook serves as 1) a simple demo showing how to submit multi-mode submissions and 2) to talk about ensembling raster sizes. As you can read about here raster_size parameter changes how much of the scene the rasterized image shows: a larger raster size increases the region that the model sees during training. As such, it is an important hyperparameter. Does our model need to see agents from very far away? Or should we force it to focus on agents near it? Why don't we do both? We can train models on different raster sizes and then ensemble their predictions via the multi-mode submission ability of this competition NotesAll the pre-trained models are saved here, so you can just add this dataset to a Kaggle kernel and run inference with it, like I do here to get the different raster size predictions that I am blending. You could also just download the output of this kernel if you want the prediction .csv.
