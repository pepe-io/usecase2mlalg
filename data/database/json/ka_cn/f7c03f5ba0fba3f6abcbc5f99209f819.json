{"title": "Denoising + Ben's Preprocessing = Better Clarity", "description": "Inspired by Applying Ben's PreprocessingMy Own Insight: Denoising after Ben's Preprocssing Leads To Better Visual ClarityApplying Ben's Preprocessing introduces noises(I assume gaussian?) to images at a certain level and thus denoising can help reduce such negative effect. (Even some characters inked from back of the page becomes more recognizable). However, the cons:  The denoising takes WAY TOO LONG. On average, each image requires about 21-23 seconds to be denoised.  The denoising algorithm in nature cause slight loss of information. However, in my opinion, the loss of information it cause is acceptable compared to its benefits.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/hanmingliu/denoising-ben-s-preprocessing-better-clarity", "tags": ["CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-08-01 23:25:14", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:36:30", "words": 97, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "description_category_score": 0.4484809339046478, "description_category_runtime": 10.531, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.641676664352417, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.835, "category": "Justice, Law and Regulations", "category_score": 0.4484809339046478, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.641676664352417, "runtime_cat": 26.366, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.645", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999965955378752", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "inspired applying ben preprocessingmy insight denoising ben preprocssing lead better visual clarityapplying ben preprocessing introduces noisesi assume gaussian image certain level thus denoising help reduce negative effect even character inked back page becomes recognizable however con denoising take way long average image requires 2123 second denoised denoising algorithm nature cause slight loss information however opinion loss information cause acceptable compared benefit", "tags_descriptive": ["Computer Vision (CV)"]}
