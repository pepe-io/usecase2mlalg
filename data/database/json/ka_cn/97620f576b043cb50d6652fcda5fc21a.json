Nakama's fantastic starter code .I have got to know about this Attention Based Interpretable Machine Learning -TabNet from https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek  and  wanted to try this out in TReNDs problem . I have limited experience in Machine Learning , so  may not have understood many places or there might be mistakes.I have used the below github repo  https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet/blob/develop/pytorch_tabnet Content is taken mainly from the original paper for TabNet . https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442 Note : I have not really played around with parameters of TabNet . Planning to do that in subsequent versions. Anyone interested also can try.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/phoenix9032/trends-google-tabnet-baseline", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch", "lightgbm"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-27 19:16:00", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:52:38", "words": 106, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.006, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.20532767474651337, "description_category_runtime": 12.41, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9921162128448486, "description_subcategory_runtime": 19.527, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.20532767474651337, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9921162128448486, "runtime_cat": 31.937, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.695", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997005190452", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "hello complete code workflow adopted nakamas fantastic starter code got know attention based interpretable machine learning tabnet httpswwwkagglecomabhishek wanted try trend problem limited experience machine learning may understood many place might mistakesi used github repo httpsgithubcomdreamquarkaitabnetblobdeveloppytorch_tabnet content taken mainly original paper tabnet httpsarxivorgabs190807442 note really played around parameter tabnet planning subsequent version anyone interested also try", "tags_descriptive": []}
