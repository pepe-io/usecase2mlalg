{"title": " Kaggle DeepFake Detection Introduction", "description": "Can you detect the deepfake? Come here for a summary? Here is a tl;dr:  I strongly encourage you start first with the official Getting Started guide here. What is the goal of the Deepfake Detection Challenge? According to the FAQ \"The AI technologies that power deepfakes and other tampered media are rapidly evolving, making deepfakes so hard to detect that, at times, even human evaluators can\u2019t reliably tell the difference. The Deepfake Detection Challenge is designed to incentivize rapid progress in this area by inviting participants to compete to create new ways of detecting and preventing manipulated media.\" This is a Code Competition: CPU Notebook <= 9 hours run-time, GPU Notebook <= 9 hours run-time on Kaggle's P100 GPUs, No internet access enabled External data is allowed up to 1 GB in size. External data must be freely & publicly available, including pre-trained models   This code competition's training set is not available directly on Kaggle, as its size is prohibitively large to train in Kaggle. Instead, it's strongly recommended that you train offline and load the externally trained model as an external dataset into Kaggle Notebooks to perform inference on the Test Set.
