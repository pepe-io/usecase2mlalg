{"title": "Embedding NCAA Model", "description": "Utilizing Embedding to Predict NCAA GamesInspired by http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1008.pdf, an outcome based embedding model, I was tempted to try and predict the outcome of NCAA games. Treating each team as an entity, I look at one season (2017) and see if there is anything to gain from the resulting embeddings afterwards. I then augment the model by jointly estimating the points scored by each team as well, and review the embeddings again.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/abhijitbrahme/embedding-ncaa-model", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2019-02-18 04:20:27", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:59:30", "words": 71, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.001, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.7144953608512878, "description_category_runtime": 9.026, "description_subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6536789536476135, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.364, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.7144953608512878, "subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "subcategory_score": 0.6536789536476135, "runtime_cat": 22.392, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.62", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999972695326202", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "utilizing embedding predict ncaa gamesinspired httpwwwsloansportsconferencecomwpcontentuploads2018021008pdf outcome based embedding model tempted try predict outcome ncaa game treating team entity look one season 2017 see anything gain resulting embeddings afterwards augment model jointly estimating point scored team well review embeddings", "tags_descriptive": []}
