{"title": "M5 Forecast: Keras with Categorical Embeddings V2", "description": "M5 Forecast: Keras with Categorical Embeddings V2This notebook tries to model expected sales of product groups. Since many of the features are categorical, we use this example to show how embedding layers make life easy when dealing with categoric inputs for neural nets by skipping the step of making dummy variables by hand. Data preprocessing and feature engineering is very similar (but not identical) to this R kernel and uses ideas from the two excellent kernels Very fst Model and M5 ForecasteR. To gain an extra 3 GB of RAM, we do not use GPU acceleration for the training.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/mayer79/m5-forecast-keras-with-categorical-embeddings-v2", "tags": ["DL"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-03-29 14:42:45", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 13:22:57", "words": 99, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.11812185496091843, "description_category_runtime": 9.497, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.419003427028656, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.214, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.11812185496091843, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.419003427028656, "runtime_cat": 23.711, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.7", "engagement_score": "0.768", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999986406373361", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "m5 forecast kera categorical embeddings v2this notebook try model expected sale product group since many feature categorical use example show embedding layer make life easy dealing categoric input neural net skipping step making dummy variable hand data preprocessing feature engineering similar identical r kernel us idea two excellent kernel fst model m5 forecaster gain extra 3 gb ram use gpu acceleration training", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)"]}
