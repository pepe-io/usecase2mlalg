{"title": "Dynamics of New York city - Animation", "description": "How does the traffic of Taxi rides change along the day? In order to answer this question, I would use K-means clustering to cluster New York into different groups based on location, and analyze the traffic into and out of every cluster as a function of the time along the day. One can expect that residential areas would have more incoming traffic in the evening, whereas commercial areas would mostly attract people during the day, and areas with rich nightlife would show more traffic in the night. This can be helpful in duration prediction, as we can learn what are the likely destinations for each area during different times of the day.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/dynamics-of-new-york-city-animation", "tags": ["K-means"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pattern"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-12-09 15:50:12", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:39:46", "words": 112, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.21582256257534027, "description_category_runtime": 9.431, "description_subcategory": "Transportation", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9260319471359253, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.363, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.21582256257534027, "subcategory": "Transportation", "subcategory_score": 0.9260319471359253, "runtime_cat": 23.794, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.789", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978315107012", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "traffic taxi ride change along day order answer question would use kmeans clustering cluster new york different group based location analyze traffic every cluster function time along day one expect residential area would incoming traffic evening whereas commercial area would mostly attract people day area rich nightlife would show traffic night helpful duration prediction learn likely destination area different time day", "tags_descriptive": ["K-means"]}
