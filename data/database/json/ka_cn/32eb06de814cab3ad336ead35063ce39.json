{"title": "EfficientNets + Quantile Regression (Inference)", "description": "Overview & Remarks Just some experiments I did with efficientnets b0-b7 and blending predictions Best LB of efficientnets was around -0.6922 Tried blending efficientnets b0-b7 in a single run but due to out-of-memory errors, it was not successful you may find the code to perform the mean blend here as well   EfficientNets are trained for 30 or 50 epochs with modified callbacks and training parameters More models are being experimented currently. Will update this notebook when I have better results!", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/khoongweihao/efficientnets-quantile-regression-inference", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "keras", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-21 08:19:49", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:44:51", "words": 82, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.005, "description_category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "description_category_score": 0.2875777781009674, "description_category_runtime": 8.588, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9353725910186768, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.299, "category": "Biotechnological & Life Sciences", "category_score": 0.2875777781009674, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9353725910186768, "runtime_cat": 21.888, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.759", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999961168721884", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "overview remark experiment efficientnets b0b7 blending prediction best lb efficientnets around 06922 tried blending efficientnets b0b7 single run due outofmemory error successful may find code perform mean blend well efficientnets trained 30 50 epoch modified callback training parameter model experimented currently update notebook better result", "tags_descriptive": []}
