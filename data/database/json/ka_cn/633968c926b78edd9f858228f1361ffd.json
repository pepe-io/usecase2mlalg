{"title": "Overview of popular Image  Augmentation packages ", "description": "Increasing the amount and diversity of data. Deep learning techniques have found great success when it comes to computer vision tasks namely image recognition, image segmentation, object detection, etc. Such deep learning techniques are heavily dependent on big data to avoid overfitting. So what do you do when you have limited data? Your go for Data Augmentation. Data Augmentation techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. In this notebook, we shall look at some of the common image augmentation techniques and some of the popular libraries which help to achieve these augmentations. Types of Augmentations There are broadly two kinds of Augmentations", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/overview-of-popular-image-augmentation-packages", "tags": ["DL", "Plants", "CV"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["keras", "albumentations", "Pillow", "opencv-python", "skimage"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-05-12 08:22:16", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 15:33:04", "words": 116, "sentences": 7, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.4430334270000458, "description_category_runtime": 10.143, "description_subcategory": "Quality", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7054683566093445, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.837, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.4430334270000458, "subcategory": "Quality", "subcategory_score": 0.7054683566093445, "runtime_cat": 25.98, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.78", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999968131022403", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "increasing amount diversity data deep learning technique found great success come computer vision task namely image recognition image segmentation object detection etc deep learning technique heavily dependent big data avoid overfitting limited data go data augmentation data augmentation technique enhance size quality training datasets better deep learning model built using notebook shall look common image augmentation technique popular library help achieve augmentation type augmentation broadly two kind augmentation", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Plants", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
