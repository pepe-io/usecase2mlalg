{"title": "Predicting stock returns by XGBoost", "description": "We are going to use XGBoost regressor to predict the stock returns in the following two days. I did not see much notebook here. Let me know if it is unproper to post this note. The key ideas in this work are (1) using XGBoost to preselect the ten most important features to fight overfitting, (2) using the linear loss function instead of the conventional square loss function. The final model consistently outperforms the all-zero predict. In my test, the model also performed better than the median prediction and could rank 30th in the private leaderboard.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/zonghao/predicting-stock-returns-by-xgboost", "tags": ["Finance", "Xgboost"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "xgboost", "tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-10 18:07:11", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 17:38:52", "words": 96, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.01, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.5196178555488586, "description_category_runtime": 9.37, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9403505921363831, "description_subcategory_runtime": 14.2, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.5196178555488586, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9403505921363831, "runtime_cat": 23.57, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.657", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999978928072084", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "going use xgboost regressor predict stock return following two day see much notebook let know unproper post note key idea work 1 using xgboost preselect ten important feature fight overfitting 2 using linear loss function instead conventional square loss function final model consistently outperforms allzero predict test model also performed better median prediction could rank 30th private leaderboard", "tags_descriptive": ["Finance", "Xgboost"]}
