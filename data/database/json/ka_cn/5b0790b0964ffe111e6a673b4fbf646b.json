{"title": "EDA for ASHRAE ", "description": "Introduction In this competition we are to create a model to predict an energy usage per building and per meter. We are given a dataset of around 1450 buildings containing such information as building id, which is a unique identifier of a building across both train and test dataset. Meter - is the type of meter that measures the data - energy consumption in kWh. Different buildings might have different meters installed. Some of them have only one type of meter, some have all four. So we need to make a predictions for each meter of each building.
