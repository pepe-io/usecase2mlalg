{"title": "ALASKA2 Competition: Multiclass PyTorch EffNetB2", "description": "Alaska2 Competiton: EDA and Understanding1. Competition Outline Steganography is the method of hiding secret data in any image/audio/video. In a nutshell, the main motive of steganography is to hide the intended information within any image/audio/video that doesn\u2019t appear to be secret just by looking at 1.1 Description Current Methods : Produce unreliable results, raising false alarms Data : images acquired with ~ 50 different cameras and processed in different fashions  1.2 Evaluation submissions are evaluated on the weighted AUC each region of the ROC curve is weighted according to these chosen parameters: tpr_thresholds = [0.0, 0.4, 1.0] weights = [2, 1]     1.3 Sumbission fileFor each Id (image) in the test set, you must provide a score that indicates how likely this image contains hidden data: the higher the score, the more it is assumed that image contains secret data. 1.4 DataFiles  Cover/ contains 75k unaltered images meant for use in training. JMiPOD/ contains 75k examples of the JMiPOD algorithm applied to the cover images. JUNIWARD/ contains 75k examples of the JUNIWARD algorithm applied to the cover images. UERD/ contains 75k examples of the UERD algorithm applied to the cover images. Test/ contains 5k test set images.
