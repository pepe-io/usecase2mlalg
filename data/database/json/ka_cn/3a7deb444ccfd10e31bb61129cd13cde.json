{"title": "Bounding box prediction using Faster RCNN Resnet", "description": "This is a baseline kernel, the purpose of this kernel to provide the insight of the competition. It is using Faster RCNN Inception Resnet v2 pretrained model on Old Open Image Dataset that contains 545 classes similar to New Open Image Dataset. I have done some analysis between old and new dataset's classes, checkout this kernel. I have used Model Zoo's utility files for object detection purpose.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/aldrin644/bounding-box-prediction-using-faster-rcnn-resnet", "tags": ["DL", "Transfer Learning"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["tensorflow"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2018-08-16 21:25:31", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 20:15:53", "words": 67, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.3256988525390625, "description_category_runtime": 6.99, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9226630926132202, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.459, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.3256988525390625, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9226630926132202, "runtime_cat": 17.449, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.757", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977841044912", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "baseline kernel purpose kernel provide insight competition using faster rcnn inception resnet v2 pretrained model old open image dataset contains 545 class similar new open image dataset done analysis old new datasets class checkout kernel used model zoo utility file object detection purpose", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Transfer Learning"]}
