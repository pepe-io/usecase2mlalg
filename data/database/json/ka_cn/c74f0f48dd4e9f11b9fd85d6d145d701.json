{"title": "Experimental Data Analysis", "description": "Intel & MobileODT Cervical Cancer ScreeningWelcome to another image processing competition! This time it's a competition from Intel, where we are trying to predict the cervix type from cervical images, before they might develop into cancer. The goal is to predict one of three classes, so this seems like a straightforward image classification challenge, with the mlogloss evaluation metric.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/anokas/experimental-data-analysis", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-03-15 20:26:15", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 11:58:48", "words": 59, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Healthcare", "description_category_score": 0.36830052733421326, "description_category_runtime": 6.351, "description_subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "description_subcategory_score": 0.6841556429862976, "description_subcategory_runtime": 9.606, "category": "Healthcare", "category_score": 0.36830052733421326, "subcategory": "Preventative and Reactive", "subcategory_score": 0.6841556429862976, "runtime_cat": 15.956, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.67", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999964923941908", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "intel mobileodt cervical cancer screeningwelcome another image processing competition time competition intel trying predict cervix type cervical image might develop cancer goal predict one three class seems like straightforward image classification challenge mlogloss evaluation metric", "tags_descriptive": []}
