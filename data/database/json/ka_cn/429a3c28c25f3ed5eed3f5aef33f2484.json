{"title": "GLR - EDA(all you need to know)", "description": "1. IntroductionGoogle Landmark Recognition is an image classification challenges like the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), which aims to recognize 1K general object categories. Landmark recognition is a little different from that: it contains a much larger number of classes (there are more than 81K classes in this challenge), and the number of training examples per class may not be very large. Landmark recognition is challenging in its own way.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsingh9990/glr-eda-all-you-need-to-know", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": [], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-08-06 21:47:53", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:43:16", "words": 72, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.340336412191391, "description_category_runtime": 7.375, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7736714482307434, "description_subcategory_runtime": 11.306, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.340336412191391, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.7736714482307434, "runtime_cat": 18.682, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "0.5", "engagement_score": "0.686", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997628090235", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "1 introductiongoogle landmark recognition image classification challenge like imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge ilsvrc aim recognize 1k general object category landmark recognition little different contains much larger number class 81k class challenge number training example per class may large landmark recognition challenging way", "tags_descriptive": []}
