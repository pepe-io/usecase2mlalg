{"title": "[CRGL2020] Iterative CNN Approach", "description": "Task overview/Game RulesThe game consists of a board of cells that are either on or off. One creates an initial configuration of these on/off states and observes how it evolves. There are four simple rules to determine the next state of the game board, given the current state:  #### Overpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies. #### Stasis: if a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives. #### Underpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies. #### Reproduction: if a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/hasnainajmal281/iterative-cnn-approach", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn", "pytorch"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-09-05 08:35:41", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:58:02", "words": 114, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Utilities", "description_category_score": 0.1767980456352234, "description_category_runtime": 10.551, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.2540283203125, "description_subcategory_runtime": 16.075, "category": "Utilities", "category_score": 0.1767980456352234, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.2540283203125, "runtime_cat": 26.627, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.629", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.999997327587385", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "task overviewgame rulesthe game consists board cell either one creates initial configuration onoff state observes evolves four simple rule determine next state game board given current state overpopulation living cell surrounded three living cell dy stasis living cell surrounded two three living cell survives underpopulation living cell surrounded fewer two living cell dy reproduction dead cell surrounded exactly three cell becomes live cell", "tags_descriptive": []}
