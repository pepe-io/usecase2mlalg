{"title": "[TPU-Inference] Super Fast XLMRoberta", "description": "Super Fast Inference [~ 2 min] using multi TPU on PyTorch/XLAHi everyone! My name is Alex Shonenkov, I am researcher, in Love with NLP and DL. First of all, I would like to say \"BIG THANKS\" organizers of this competition:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge 6.5% kernels were crushed on Private Stage, despite on success in Public Stage. And many teams have got score 0.5 for every sample in prediction and get score 0.69314. For example, 3th public place \"WestLake\" have got this score. https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/discussion/145623 I have silver zone solution in computer vision competition, but I didn't take medal. https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/discussion/145982 After this precedent I don't see any point in continuing to do any competitions. I would like to share knowledges with you, my friends. P.S. I am sorry for high score kernels, but I hope you can improve your solutions using my kernels.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/tpu-inference-super-fast-xlmroberta", "tags": ["DL", "NLP"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["pytorch", "albumentations", "nltk", "spacy"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-04-26 21:49:26", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 12:15:35", "words": 140, "sentences": 9, "runtime": 0.01, "description_category": "Education & Research", "description_category_score": 0.6254763007164001, "description_category_runtime": 17.938, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7264269590377808, "description_subcategory_runtime": 28.965, "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 0.6254763007164001, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7264269590377808, "runtime_cat": 46.903, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.762", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999962489038483", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "super fast inference 2 min using multi tpu pytorchxlahi everyone name alex shonenkov researcher love nlp dl first would like say big thanks organizer competition httpswwwkagglecomcdeepfakedetectionchallenge 65 kernel crushed private stage despite success public stage many team got score 05 every sample prediction get score 069314 example 3th public place westlake got score httpswwwkagglecomcdeepfakedetectionchallengediscussion145623 silver zone solution computer vision competition didnt take medal httpswwwkagglecomcdeepfakedetectionchallengediscussion145982 precedent dont see point continuing competition would like share knowledge friend p sorry high score kernel hope improve solution using kernel", "tags_descriptive": ["Deep Learning (DL)", "Natural Language Processing (NLP)"]}
