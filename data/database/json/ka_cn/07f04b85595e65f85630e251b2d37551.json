{"title": "Likelihood encoding of categorical features", "description": "This is just a simple implementation of likelihood encoding (also known as impact coding or target coding) for the categorical features in python. Just trying to understand how it works. I'm pretty certain code can be improved, specially regarding the creation of the mapping and its application, but I preserved the same implementation I used in which application to the training data, and creation of the encoding map are two different steps.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/tnarik/likelihood-encoding-of-categorical-features", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2017-07-15 12:14:28", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 14:11:17", "words": 72, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "description_category_score": 0.05298561230301857, "description_category_runtime": 6.812, "description_subcategory": "Student", "description_subcategory_score": 0.3284303843975067, "description_subcategory_runtime": 10.283, "category": "Real Estate, Rental & Leasing", "category_score": 0.05298561230301857, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.3284303843975067, "runtime_cat": 17.096, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.768", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999958304951583", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "simple implementation likelihood encoding also known impact coding target coding categorical feature python trying understand work im pretty certain code improved specially regarding creation mapping application preserved implementation used application training data creation encoding map two different step", "tags_descriptive": []}
