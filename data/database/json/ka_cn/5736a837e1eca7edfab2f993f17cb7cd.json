{"title": "Cultural Diffusion by Recipes", "description": "GENERAL DESCRIPTION:Capturing cultural diffusion by converting each cuisine to a TF-IDF vector (based on its ingredients), using PCA to obtain two vectors for visualization purposes, and clustering them by K-Means. There are several improvements that one could easily think of, but the basic results prove to be quite good - Asia for example is separate from the rest and notice how the 'filipino' cuisine is also slightly separate from the rest of Asia (it is known to be quite different from the other Asian cuisines).", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/alonalevy/cultural-diffusion-by-recipes", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["sklearn"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2016-12-03 16:06:00", "date_scraped": "2020-12-13 18:21:34", "words": 85, "sentences": 2, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.264970064163208, "description_category_runtime": 8.489, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9959068894386292, "description_subcategory_runtime": 12.91, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.264970064163208, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.9959068894386292, "runtime_cat": 21.399, "programming_language": "Jupyter Notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.762", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977507438504", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "general descriptioncapturing cultural diffusion converting cuisine tfidf vector based ingredient using pca obtain two vector visualization purpose clustering kmeans several improvement one could easily think basic result prove quite good asia example separate rest notice filipino cuisine also slightly separate rest asia known quite different asian cuisine", "tags_descriptive": []}
