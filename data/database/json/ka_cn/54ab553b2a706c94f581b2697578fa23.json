{"title": "Task Tagging", "description": "Done!--All training tasks tagged. In the following (hidden) cells I create a dataframe to encode task tags and properties in a way that could possibly generalize to further tasks. The classification is far from perfect and depends largely on my ability to describe task resolution in a DSL-ish and transferrable way, so any help and corrections are greatly appreciated. All my gratitude to boliu0 for making this bearable. The dataframe can be imported from the outputs of this kernel. In my other notebook I multiply the number of tasks in the training set, while preserving tags.  Contents  The tagging itself EDA Other Features Can We Predict Tags?
