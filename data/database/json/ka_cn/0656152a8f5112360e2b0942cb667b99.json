{"title": "TReNDS - PyCaret (Training + Inference)", "description": "1. Introduction to PyCaretPyCaret is an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python that aims to reduce the cycle time from hypothesis to insights. It is well suited for seasoned data scientists who want to increase the productivity of their ML experiments by using PyCaret in their workflows or for citizen data scientists and those new to data science with little or no background in coding. PyCaret allows you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model within seconds using your choice of notebook environment. Please click this link to continue learning more about PyCaret.
