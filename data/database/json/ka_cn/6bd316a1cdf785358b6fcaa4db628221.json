{"title": "Beginner friendly Fastext + BiLSTMCNN- Top 1%", "description": "Here are some of my experiences with the movie review sentiment analysis dataset  ( I have also documented my other experiences with Text and NLP ).  The dataset of this competition turned out to be different (read weird here), in a sense regular Data Preparation/Cleansing and Feature harvesting didn't work. But this gave me a great learning.  I tried many possible combinations of data preparation/cleansing, feature extraction and network architectures.
