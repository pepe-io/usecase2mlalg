{"title": "Finding the optimal weight between three models \u2697\ufe0f", "description": "This kernel shows you how to find the best combination of three methods using a visual approach.In machine learning, mixtures of different models are often used to reduce variance. This raises the question of the best mix. Several points make the answer difficult.  The mixture can only be determined in the training data set but not in the test data set.  Finding the best mix for several models is problematic because of the dimensionality, since a maximum of three dimensions can be represented - perhaps four or more dimensions due to different colours and shapes.    In this kernel I will show you how to find a good mix with three different methods using the cat2 competition dataset.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/frankmollard/finding-the-optimal-weight-between-three-models", "tags": ["Logistic Regression", "Naive Bayes", "Ensembling"], "kind": ["Project", "(Notebook)"], "ml_libs": ["h2o"], "host": "kaggle.com", "license": "Apache-2.0", "language": "english", "date_project": "2020-07-24 13:26:47", "date_scraped": "2020-12-12 17:42:12", "words": 122, "sentences": 6, "runtime": 0.007, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.14514151215553284, "description_category_runtime": 9.906, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.9808872938156128, "description_subcategory_runtime": 15.139, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.14514151215553284, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9808872938156128, "runtime_cat": 25.045, "programming_language": "R notebook", "ml_score": "1.0", "engagement_score": "0.662", "language_code": "en", "language_score": "0.9999977522412138", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "kernel show find best combination three method using visual approachin machine learning mixture different model often used reduce variance raise question best mix several point make answer difficult mixture determined training data set test data set finding best mix several model problematic dimensionality since maximum three dimension represented perhaps four dimension due different colour shape kernel show find good mix three different method using cat2 competition dataset", "tags_descriptive": ["Logistic Regression", "Naive Bayes", "Ensembling"]}
