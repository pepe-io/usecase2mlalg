Due to the combinatorial aspect of combining fashion articles, the available images are limited to a pre-determined set of outfits. In this paper, we broaden these visualizations by generating high-resolution images of fashion models wearing a custom outfit under an input body pose. We show that our approach can not only transfer the style and the pose of one generated outfit to another, but also create realistic images of human bodies and garments.", "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 1, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 1, "ml_score": "1", "host": "zalando.com", "kind": "Article", "date_scraped": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "learn_score": 0.5, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0.75, "words": 84, "sentences": 4, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999947297187629", "runtime": 0.001, "description_lemmatized": "visualizing outfit essential part shopping clothes due combinatorial aspect combining fashion article available image limited predetermined set outfit paper broaden visualization generating highresolution image fashion model wearing custom outfit input body pose show approach transfer style pose one generated outfit another also create realistic image human body garment", "tags_descriptive": ["Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)", "Computer Vision (CV)", "Pattern Recognition", "Fashion"]}
