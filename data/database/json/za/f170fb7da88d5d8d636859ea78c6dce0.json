There, the item is represented by a vector, its Fashion DNA. Unlike the catalog data, Fashion DNA is a fundamentally geometrical representation: The similarity between two articles is encoded by their distance in fashion space, while article properties (is it blue? Is it a dress? Is it offered by Nike? Does customer #1,234,567 like it?) are associated with specific directions in this space.", "source": "", "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 1, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 1, "learn_score": "0.0", "explore_score": "0.0", "compete_score": "1.0", "host": "zalando.com", "kind": "Article", "words": 93, "sentences": 3, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.999997647854682", "runtime": 0.002, "description_lemmatized": "make property fashion item accessible collect array information catalog map abstract mathematical linear space fashion space item represented vector fashion dna unlike catalog data fashion dna fundamentally geometrical representation similarity two article encoded distance fashion space article property blue dress offered nike customer 1234567 like associated specific direction space", "tags_descriptive": ["Fashion", "t-SNE", "DNN", "Recommender", "Image Tagging", "Labeling", "Trend Revealing", "Rank Competitors"]}
