For example, we want to predict a consumer's interest in ordering selected fashion articles. We set ourselves the goal to build a powerful and versatile prediction tool that not only fits the task at hand, but is also ready for future product developments.", "source": "", "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 1, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 1, "date_project": "2017-03-22 00:00:00", "learn_score": "0.0", "explore_score": "0.0", "compete_score": "0.75", "host": "zalando.com", "kind": "Article", "words": 66, "sentences": 3, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.999994991113794", "runtime": 0.003, "description_lemmatized": "recent product requires precise estimate future interest zalando consumer based history interacting fashion platform example want predict consumer interest ordering selected fashion article set goal build powerful versatile prediction tool fit task hand also ready future product development", "tags_descriptive": ["Fashion", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)"]}
