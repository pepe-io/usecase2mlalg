It emphasizes that visual appearance is key to fashion. The look of fashion can even be more important than fit and size: many people are willing to trade worse fit with better looks, in particular for short-term or singular events. In a digitized world, a look is represented as an image in a computer. The research focus and purpose of this project is to generate and manipulate images related to the fashion domain by using Machine Learning (ML).", "source": "", "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 1, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 1, "learn_score": "0.0", "explore_score": "0.0", "compete_score": "1.0", "host": "zalando.com", "kind": "Article", "words": 99, "sentences": 5, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999967142366691", "runtime": 0.001, "description_lemmatized": "look question typically asked someone try new type clothing shoe emphasizes visual appearance key fashion look fashion even important fit size many people willing trade worse fit better look particular shortterm singular event digitized world look represented image computer research focus purpose project generate manipulate image related fashion domain using machine learning ml", "tags_descriptive": ["Fashion", "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)", "Computer Vision (CV)"]}
