Useful applications of language modeling to downstream tasks such as predicting customer ratings from textual reviews (\u201csentiment analysis\u201d) or locating mentions of fashion brands in a large corpus of text (\u201cnamed-entity-recognition\u201d). We use techniques based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling.", "source": "", "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 1, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 1, "learn_score": "0.5", "explore_score": "0.0", "compete_score": "1.0", "host": "zalando.com", "kind": "Article", "words": 62, "sentences": 3, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999986066831471", "runtime": 0.002, "description_lemmatized": "aim project use intrinsic structure language train deeplearn model better model textual data useful application language modeling downstream task predicting customer rating textual review sentiment analysis locating mention fashion brand large corpus text namedentityrecognition use technique based sequential monte carlo sampling", "tags_descriptive": ["Fashion", "Sentiment Analysis", "Named Entity Recognition (NER)", "Deep Learning (DL)"]}
