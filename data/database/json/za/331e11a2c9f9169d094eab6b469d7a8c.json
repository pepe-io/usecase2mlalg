In particular, we demonstrate our method in controlling color, texture, and shape of a generated garment image for computer-aided fashion design. To disentangle the effect of input attributes, we customize conditional GANs with consistency loss functions. In our experiments, we tune one input at a time and show that we can guide our network to generate novel and realistic images of clothing articles. In addition, we present a fashion design process that estimates the input attributes of an existing garment and modifies them using our generator.", "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 1, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 1, "ml_score": "1", "host": "zalando.com", "kind": "Article", "date_scraped": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "learn_score": 0.5, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0.75, "words": 106, "sentences": 5, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999952442951586", "runtime": 0.003, "description_lemmatized": "paper propose method disentangles effect multiple input condition generative adversarial network gans particular demonstrate method controlling color texture shape generated garment image computeraided fashion design disentangle effect input attribute customize conditional gans consistency loss function experiment tune one input time show guide network generate novel realistic image clothing article addition present fashion design process estimate input attribute existing garment modifies using generator", "tags_descriptive": ["Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)", "Computer Vision (CV)", "Pattern Recognition", "Fashion"]}
