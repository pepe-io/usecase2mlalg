A hypernetwork initializes the weights of another network, which in turn can be employed for typical functional tasks such as regression and classification. We optimize hypernetworks to directly maximize the conditional likelihood of target variables given input. Using this approach we obtain competitive empirical results on regression and classification benchmarks.", "category": "Education & Research", "category_score": 1, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 1, "ml_score": "1", "host": "zalando.com", "kind": "Article", "date_scraped": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "learn_score": 0.5, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0.75, "words": 61, "sentences": 4, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.99999590533977", "runtime": 0.0, "description_lemmatized": "work explores maximum likelihood optimization neural network hypernetworks hypernetwork initializes weight another network turn employed typical functional task regression classification optimize hypernetworks directly maximize conditional likelihood target variable given input using approach obtain competitive empirical result regression classification benchmark", "tags_descriptive": ["Bayesian", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Fashion"]}
