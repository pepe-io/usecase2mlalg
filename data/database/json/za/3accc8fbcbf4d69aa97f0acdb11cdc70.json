Via adversarial learning, we trained a model on top of Fashion DNA with the task to forget all article properties except for color and pattern. Examples of neighborhoods with respect to the resulting article embedding are shown below.", "source": "", "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 1, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 1, "learn_score": "0.0", "explore_score": "0.0", "compete_score": "1.0", "host": "zalando.com", "kind": "Article", "words": 69, "sentences": 3, "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999971466411264", "runtime": 0.001, "description_lemmatized": "article embedding encodes particular type fabric season targeted gender age color well brand fashion item fashion dna via adversarial learning trained model top fashion dna task forget article property except color pattern example neighborhood respect resulting article embedding shown", "tags_descriptive": ["Fashion", "Deep Learning (DL)", "Computer Vision (CV)", "Adversarial Learning", "Research"]}
