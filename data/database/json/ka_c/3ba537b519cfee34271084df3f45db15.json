{"title": "Allstate Claims Severity", "description": "How severe is an insurance claim?When you\u2019ve been devastated by a serious car accident, your focus is on the things that matter the most: family, friends, and other loved ones. Pushing paper with your insurance agent is the last place you want your time or mental energy spent. This is why Allstate, a personal insurer in the United States, is continually seeking fresh ideas to improve their claims service for the over 16 million households they protect.  Allstate is currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this recruitment challenge, Kagglers are invited to show off their creativity and flex their technical chops by creating\u00a0an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity. Aspiring competitors will demonstrate\u00a0insight into better ways to predict claims severity for the chance to be part of Allstate\u2019s efforts to ensure a worry-free customer experience.
