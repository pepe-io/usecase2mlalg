{"title": "Leaf Classification", "description": "Can you see the random forest for the leaves?There are estimated to be nearly half a million species of plant in the world. Classification of species has been historically problematic and often results in duplicate identifications. Automating plant recognition might\u00a0have many applications, including:       The objective of this playground competition is to use binary leaf images and extracted\u00a0features, including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify 99\u00a0species of plants. Leaves, due to their volume, prevalence, and unique characteristics, are an effective means of differentiating plant species. They also provide a fun introduction to applying techniques that involve image-based features. As a first step, try building a classifier that uses the provided pre-extracted features. Next, try creating a set of your own features. Finally, examine the errors you're making and see what you can do to improve.
