{"title": "How Much Did It Rain? II", "description": "Predict hourly rainfall using data from polarimetric radarsAfter incorporating\u00a0feedback from the Kaggle community, as well as scientific and educational partners, the\u00a0Artificial Intelligence Committee of the American Meteorological Society\u00a0is\u00a0excited to be running a second\u00a0iteration of the How Much Did It Rain?\u00a0competition. How Much Did It Rain? II is focused on solving the same core rain measurement prediction problem, but approaches it with a new and improved dataset and evaluation metric. This competition will go even further towards building a\u00a0useful educational tool for universities, as well as making a meaningful contribution to continued meteorological research. Competition\u00a0Description Rainfall is highly variable across space and time, making it notoriously tricky to measure. Rain gauges can be an\u00a0effective measurement tool for a specific location, but it is impossible to have them everywhere. In order to have widespread coverage, data from weather radars is\u00a0used to estimate rainfall nationwide.\u00a0Unfortunately, these predictions never exactly match the measurements taken\u00a0using rain gauges. Recently, in an effort to improve their rainfall predictors, the U.S. National Weather Service upgraded their radar network to be polarimetric. These polarimetric radars are able to provide higher quality\u00a0data than conventional Doppler radars\u00a0because they\u00a0transmit radio wave pulses with both horizontal and vertical orientations.\u00a0  Dual pulses make it easier to infer the size and type of precipitation because rain drops become flatter as they increase in size,\u00a0whereas\u00a0ice crystals tend to be elongated vertically. In this competition, you are given snapshots of polarimetric radar values and asked to predict the hourly rain gauge total. A word of caution:\u00a0many of the gauge values in the training dataset are implausible (gauges may get clogged, for example). More details are on the data page.
