{"title": "iMet Collection 2020 - FGVC7", "description": "Recognize artwork attributes from The Metropolitan Museum of ArtThe Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, also known as The Met, has a diverse collection of over 1.5M objects of which over 200K have been digitized with imagery. Can you help find the significant attributes to identify a specific work of art? Help advance this research in this notebook competition.    The online cataloguing information is generated by subject matter experts and includes a wide range of data. These include, but are not limited to: multiple object classifications, artist, title, period, date, medium, culture, size, provenance, geographic location, and other related museum objects within The Met\u2019s collection. While the annotations describe the object from an art history perspective, they can also be indirect in describing finer-grained attributes for the museum-goer\u2019s understanding. Adding fine-grained attributes to aid in the visual understanding of the museum objects will enable the ability to search for visually related objects.  This is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.
