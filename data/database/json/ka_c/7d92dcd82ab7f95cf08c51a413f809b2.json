{"title": "Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing", "description": "Can you cut the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench?Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include, for example, the passenger safety cell with crumple zone, the airbag and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium car makers. Daimler\u2019s Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams. . To ensure the safety and reliability of each and every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler\u2019s engineers have developed a robust testing system. But, optimizing the speed of their testing system for so many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach. As one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Daimler\u2019s production lines.  In this competition, Daimler is challenging Kagglers to tackle the curse of dimensionality and reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Competitors will work with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms will contribute to speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler\u2019s standards.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing", "tags": ["Xgboost", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Model Comparison"], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host": "kaggle.com", "date_project": "2017-07-11 01:59:00", "words": 224, "sentences": 12, "sum_nltk": "Can you cut the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench?Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations.\nMercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium car makers.\nDaimler\u2019s Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry.\nWith a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.\n.
