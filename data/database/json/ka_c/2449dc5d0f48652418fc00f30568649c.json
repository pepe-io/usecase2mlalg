{"title": "Bike Sharing Demand", "description": "Forecast use of a city bikeshare systemGet started\u00a0on this competition through Kaggle Scripts Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the\u00a0process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using\u00a0these systems, people are\u00a0able rent a bike from a one\u00a0location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world. The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed\u00a0is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a\u00a0sensor network, which can be used for studying\u00a0mobility in a\u00a0city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine\u00a0historical usage\u00a0patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike\u00a0rental demand in\u00a0the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.
