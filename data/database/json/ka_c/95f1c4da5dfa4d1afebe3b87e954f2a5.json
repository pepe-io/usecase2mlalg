{"title": "ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III", "description": "How much energy will a building consume?Q: How much does it cost to cool a skyscraper in the summer? A: A lot! And not just in dollars, but in environmental impact. Thankfully, significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions. The question is, are the improvements working? That\u2019s where you come in. Under pay-for-performance financing, the building owner makes payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. The latter values have to come from a model. Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well. Some assume a specific meter type or don\u2019t work with different building types. In this competition, you\u2019ll develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies. About the Host  Founded in 1894, ASHRAE serves to advance the arts and sciences of heating, ventilation, air conditioning refrigeration and their allied fields. ASHRAE members represent building system design and industrial process professionals around the world. With over 54,000 members serving in 132 countries, ASHRAE supports research, standards writing, publishing and continuing education - shaping tomorrow\u2019s built environment today.
