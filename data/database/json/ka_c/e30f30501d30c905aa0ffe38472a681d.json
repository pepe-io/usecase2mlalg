{"title": "Data Science for Good: CareerVillage.org", "description": "Match career advice questions with professionals in the fieldWelcome In this competition you'll notice there isn't a leaderboard, and you are not required to develop a predictive model. This isn't a traditional supervised Kaggle machine learning competition.  CareerVillage.org is a nonprofit that crowdsources career advice for underserved youth. Founded in 2011 in four classrooms in New York City, the platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. The platform uses a Q&A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.  In this Data Science for Good challenge, CareerVillage.org, in partnership with Google.org, is inviting you to help recommend questions to appropriate volunteers. To support this challenge, CareerVillage.org has supplied five years of data.  Problem Statement The U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underserved youth lack the network to find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn.  To date, 25,000 volunteers have created profiles and opted in to receive emails when a career question is a good fit for them. This is where your skills come in. To help students get the advice they need, the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers. The notifications sent to volunteers seem to have the greatest impact on how many questions are answered. Your objective: develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them.  Criteria for Measuring Solutions Performance: How well does the solution match professionals to the questions they would be motivated to answer? CareerVillage.org will not be able to live-test every submission, so a strong entry will clearly articulate why it will be effective at motivating answers. Easy to implement: The CareerVillage.org team wants to put the winning submissions to work, quickly.  A good entry will be well documented and easy to test in production. Extensibility: In the future, CareerVillage.org aims to add more data features and to accommodate new objectives. Winning submissions should allow for this and other augmentations to be added in the future.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-careervillage", "tags": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Recommender"], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host": "kaggle.com", "date_project": "2019-04-24 01:59:00", "words": 374, "sentences": 20, "sum_nltk": "Match career advice questions with professionals in the fieldWelcome In this competition you'll notice there isn't a leaderboard, and you are not required to develop a predictive model.\nCareerVillage.org is a nonprofit that crowdsources career advice for underserved youth.\nFounded in 2011 in four classrooms in New York City, the platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners.\nThe platform uses a Q&A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.\nIn this Data Science for Good challenge, CareerVillage.org, in partnership with Google.org, is inviting you to help recommend questions to appropriate volunteers.\nTo help students get the advice they need, the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers.\nYour objective: develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them.\nCareerVillage.org will not be able to live-test every submission, so a strong entry will clearly articulate why it will be effective at motivating answers.\nEasy to implement: The CareerVillage.org team wants to put the winning submissions to work, quickly.\nExtensibility: In the future, CareerVillage.org aims to add more data features and to accommodate new objectives.", "sum_nltk_words": 199, "sum_nltk_runtime": 0.005, "sum_t5": "CareerVillage.org crowdsources career advice for underserved youth. the platform has served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers. the notifications sent to volunteers seem to have the greatest impact on how many questions are answered. a strong entry will be well documented and easy to test in production.. a strong entry will be well documented and easy to test in production", "sum_t5_words": 82, "sum_t5_runtime": 6.987, "runtime": 0.003, "nltk_category": "Construction & Engineering", "nltk_category_score": 0.5231413245201111, "nltk_category_runtime": 19.898, "nltk_subcategory": "Student", "nltk_subcategory_score": 0.7082018852233887, "nltk_subcategory_runtime": 31.451, "category": "Construction & Engineering", "category_score": 0.5231413245201111, "subcategory": "Student", "subcategory_score": 0.7082018852233887, "runtime_cat": 51.348, "engagement_score": "0.0", "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999976192904467", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "match career advice question professional fieldwelcome competition youll notice isnt leaderboard required develop predictive model isnt traditional supervised kaggle machine learning competition careervillageorg nonprofit crowdsources career advice underserved youth founded 2011 four classroom new york city platform served career advice 25000 volunteer professional 35m online learner platform us qa style similar stackoverflow quora provide student answer question career data science good challenge careervillageorg partnership googleorg inviting help recommend question appropriate volunteer support challenge careervillageorg supplied five year data problem statement u almost 500 student every guidance counselor underserved youth lack network find career role model making careervillageorg option million young people america around globe nowhere else turn date 25000 volunteer created profile opted receive email career question good fit skill come help student get advice need team careervillageorg need able send right question right volunteer notification sent volunteer seem greatest impact many question answered objective develop method recommend relevant question professional likely answer criterion measuring solution performance well solution match professional question would motivated answer careervillageorg able livetest every submission strong entry clearly articulate effective motivating answer easy implement careervillageorg team want put winning submission work quickly good entry well documented easy test production extensibility future careervillageorg aim add data feature accommodate new objective winning submission allow augmentation added future", "tags_descriptive": ["Exploratory Data Analysis", "Recommender"]}
