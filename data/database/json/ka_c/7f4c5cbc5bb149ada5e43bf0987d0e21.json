{"title": "Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge", "description": "Predict 3 months of item sales at different storesThis competition is provided as a way to explore different time series techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset.  You are given 5 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores. What's the best way to deal with seasonality? Should stores be modeled separately, or can you pool them together? Does deep learning work better than ARIMA? Can either beat xgboost? This is a great competition to explore different models and improve your skills in forecasting.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only", "tags": ["Feature Engineering", "Time Series Analysis", "Exploratory Data Analysis"], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host": "kaggle.com", "date_project": "2018-09-25 01:59:00", "words": 99, "sentences": 3, "runtime": 0.002, "description_category": "Wholesale & Retail", "description_category_score": 0.44146019220352173, "description_category_runtime": 9.003, "description_subcategory": "Retail", "description_subcategory_score": 0.807629406452179, "description_subcategory_runtime": 13.533, "category": "Wholesale & Retail", "category_score": 0.44146019220352173, "subcategory": "Retail", "subcategory_score": 0.807629406452179, "runtime_cat": 22.538, "engagement_score": "0.602", "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999959201365437", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "predict 3 month item sale different storesthis competition provided way explore different time series technique relatively simple clean dataset given 5 year storeitem sale data asked predict 3 month sale 50 different item 10 different store whats best way deal seasonality store modeled separately pool together deep learning work better arima either beat xgboost great competition explore different model improve skill forecasting", "tags_descriptive": ["Feature Engineering", "Time Series Analysis", "Exploratory Data Analysis"]}
