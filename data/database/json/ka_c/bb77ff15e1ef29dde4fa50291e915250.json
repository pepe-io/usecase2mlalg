{"title": "Ciphertext Challenge III", "description": "BRBTvl0LNstxQLyxulCEEq1czSFje0Z6iajczo6ktGmitTE=Ciphertext Challenge III: Wherefore Art Thou, Simple Ciphers? We've done the 2010's, the 1990s\u2026 now it's time for the 80s. The 1580s!! In this new decryption competition's dataset, we've gone from perfectly respectable sources of electronic horror to a time before computers\u2014heck, before calculus was called \"calculus\"!  Shakespeare's plays are encrypted, and we time travelers must un-encrypt them so people can do innovative stage productions with intricate makeup, costumes, and possibly\u2014possibly!\u2014Leonardo DiCaprio. Think about it, folks: Leo.* As in previous ciphertext challenges, simple classic ciphers have been used to encrypt this dataset, along with a slightly less simple surprise that expands our definition of \"classic\" into the modern age. The mission is the same: to correctly match each piece of ciphertext with its corresponding piece of plaintext. Daunting! Meta-puzzles and difficulty await! Swag prizes go to the first three teams to crack all four ciphers OR to the top three teams on the leaderboard (in case the ciphers are not all cracked). Additionally, swag prizes will be awarded to the best competition-related kernels, in both visualization and cryptanalysis, based on upvotes.  Last, the coveted \"Phil Prize\"\u2014for the team that correctly deduces the form AND key of the final cipher\u2014is up for grabs again. Go ahead. Get cracking! * - Leo!
