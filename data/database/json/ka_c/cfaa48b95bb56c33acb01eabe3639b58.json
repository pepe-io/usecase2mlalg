{"title": "Melbourne University AES/MathWorks/NIH Seizure Prediction", "description": "Predict seizures in long-term human intracranial EEG recordingsEpilepsy afflicts nearly 1% of the world's population, and is characterized by the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. For many patients, anticonvulsant medications can be given at sufficiently high doses to prevent seizures, but patients frequently suffer side effects. For 20-40% of patients with epilepsy, medications are not effective. Even after surgical removal of epilepsy, many patients continue to experience spontaneous seizures. Despite the fact that seizures occur infrequently, patients with epilepsy experience persistent anxiety due to the possibility of a seizure occurring. Seizure forecasting systems have the potential to help patients with epilepsy lead more normal lives. In order for electrical brain activity (EEG) based seizure forecasting systems to work effectively, computational algorithms must reliably identify periods of increased probability of seizure occurrence. If these seizure-permissive brain states can be identified, devices designed to warn patients of impeding seizures would be possible. Patients could avoid potentially dangerous activities like driving or swimming, and medications could be administered only when needed to prevent impending seizures, reducing overall side effects.  The Competition Transitioning from the Kaggle contests held on seizure detection and seizure prediction in 2014 that primarily involved long-term electrical brain activity recordings from dogs, the current contest focuses on seizure prediction using long-term electrical brain activity recordings from humans obtained from the world-first clinical trial of the implantable NeuroVista Seizure Advisory System. Human brain activity was recorded in the form of intracranial EEG (iEEG), which involves electrodes positioned on the surface of the cerebral cortex and the recording of electrical signals with an ambulatory monitoring system.\u00a0These are long duration recordings, spanning multiple months up to multiple years and recording large numbers of seizures in some humans.\u00a0The challenge is to distinguish between ten minute long data clips covering an hour prior to a seizure, and ten minute iEEG clips of interictal activity.\u00a0 Acknowledgments\u00a0 This competition is sponsored by MathWorks, the National Institutes of Health (NINDS), the American Epilepsy Society and the University of Melbourne, and organised in partnership with the Alliance for Epilepsy Research, the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 References", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/melbourne-university-seizure-prediction", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project",
