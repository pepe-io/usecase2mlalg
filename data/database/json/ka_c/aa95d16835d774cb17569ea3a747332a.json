{"title": "COVID19 Local US-CA Forecasting (Week 1)", "description": "Forecast daily COVID-19 spread in California, USAThis is one of the two complementary forecasting tasks to predict COVID-19 spread. This one is based on a single state-level subcomponent in California, USA. Our intent in having this region-specific version is to offer a more manageable starting point for the global forecasting task. To start on the global version, please see the companion forecasting task. Background The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle)  to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\u2019s (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Challenge Kaggle is launching two companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between March 25 and April 22 in California, the primary goal isn't to produce accurate forecasts. It\u2019s to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19. You are encouraged to pull in, curate and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your finding in a notebook.  As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.  Companies and Organizations There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle\u2019s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community. Acknowledgements JHU CSSE for making the data available to the public.
