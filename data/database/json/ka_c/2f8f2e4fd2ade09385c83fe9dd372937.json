{"title": "TMDB Box Office Prediction", "description": "Can you predict a movie's worldwide box office revenue?We're going to make you an offer you can't refuse: a Kaggle competition!  In a world\u2026 where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? For some movies, it's \"You had me at 'Hello.'\" For others, the trailer falls short of expectations and you think \"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\" In this competition, you're presented with metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries.  You can collect other publicly available data to use in your model predictions, but in the spirit of this competition, use only data that would have been available before a movie's release. Join in, \"make our day\", and then \"you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?'\"", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction", "tags": ["Feature Engineering", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Regression"], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host": "kaggle.com", "date_project": "2019-05-31 01:59:00", "words": 185, "sentences": 5, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.27027300000190735, "description_category_runtime": 16.727, "description_subcategory": "General", "description_subcategory_score": 0.42963069677352905, "description_subcategory_runtime": 26.651, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.27027300000190735, "subcategory": "General", "subcategory_score": 0.42963069677352905, "runtime_cat": 43.378, "engagement_score": "0.663", "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999975904491538", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "predict movie worldwide box office revenuewere going make offer cant refuse kaggle competition world movie made estimated 417 billion 2018 film industry popular ever movie make money box office much director matter budget movie hello others trailer fall short expectation think failure communicate competition youre presented metadata 7000 past film movie database try predict overall worldwide box office revenue data point provided include cast crew plot keywords budget poster release date language production company country collect publicly available data use model prediction spirit competition use data would available movie release join make day youve got ask one question feel lucky", "tags_descriptive": ["Feature Engineering", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Regression"]}
