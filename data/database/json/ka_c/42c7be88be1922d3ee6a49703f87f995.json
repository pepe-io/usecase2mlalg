{"title": "WSDM - KKBox's Churn Prediction Challenge", "description": "Can you predict when subscribers will churn?The 11th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2018) is challenging you to build an algorithm that predicts whether a subscription user will churn using a donated dataset from KKBOX. WSDM (pronounced \"wisdom\") is one of the the premier conferences on web inspired research involving search and data mining. They're committed to publishing original, high quality papers and presentations, with an emphasis on practical but principled novel models. For a subscription business, accurately predicting churn is critical to long-term success. Even slight variations in churn can drastically affect profits. KKBOX is Asia\u2019s leading music streaming service, holding the world\u2019s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. They offer a generous, unlimited version of their service to millions of people, supported by advertising and paid subscriptions. This delicate model is dependent on accurately predicting churn of their paid users. In this competition you\u2019re tasked to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will churn after their subscription expires. Currently, the company uses survival analysis techniques to determine the residual membership life time for each subscriber. By adopting different methods, KKBOX anticipates they\u2019ll discover new insights to why users leave so they can be proactive in keeping users dancing. Winners will present their findings at the WSDM conference February 6-8, 2018 in Los Angeles, CA.
