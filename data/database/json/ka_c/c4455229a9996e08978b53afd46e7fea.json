{"title": "Airbnb New User Bookings", "description": "Where will a new guest book their first travel experience?Instead of waking to overlooked\u00a0\"Do not disturb\" signs, Airbnb\u00a0travelers find themselves rising with the birds in a\u00a0whimsical treehouse, having their morning coffee on the deck of a houseboat,\u00a0or cooking a shared regional breakfast with their hosts. New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting\u00a0where\u00a0a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking,\u00a0and better forecast demand. In this recruiting competition, Airbnb challenges you to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking. Kagglers who impress with their answer (and an explanation of how they got there) will be considered for an interview for the opportunity to join Airbnb's Data Science and Analytics team.
