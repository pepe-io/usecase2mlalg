{"title": "Open Images 2019 - Instance Segmentation", "description": "Outline segmentation masks of objects in imagesIntroduction Computer vision has advanced considerably but is still challenged in matching the precision of human perception. Open Images is a collaborative release of ~9 million images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, and visual relationships. This uniquely large and diverse dataset is designed to spur state of the art advances in analyzing and understanding images. This year\u2019s Open Images V5 release enabled the second Open Images Challenge to include the following 3 tracks:  Object detection track for detecting bounding boxes around object instances, relaunched from 2018. Visual relationship detection track for detecting pairs of objects in particular relations, also relaunched from 2018. Instance segmentation track for segmenting masks of objects in images, brand new for 2019.  Google AI hopes that having a single dataset with unified annotations for image classification, object detection, visual relationship detection, and instance segmentation will stimulate progress towards genuine scene understanding. Instance Segmentation Track In this track of the Challenge, you are asked to provide segmentation masks of objects. This track\u2019s training set represents 2.1M segmentation masks for object instances in 300 categories; with a validation set containing an additional 23k masks. The train set masks were produced by our state-of-the-art interactive segmentation process, where professional human annotators iteratively correct the output of a segmentation neural network. The validation and test set masks have been annotated manually with a strong focus on quality.   Example train set annotations. Left: Wuxi science park, 1995 by Gary Stevens.
