{"title": "OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression", "description": "Predict lung function declineImagine one day, your breathing became consistently labored and shallow. Months later you were finally diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a disorder with no known cause and no known cure, created by scarring of the lungs. If that happened to you, you would want to know your prognosis. That\u2019s where a troubling disease becomes frightening for the patient: outcomes can range from long-term stability to rapid deterioration, but doctors aren\u2019t easily able to tell where an individual may fall on that spectrum. Your help, and data science, may be able to aid in this prediction, which would dramatically help both patients and clinicians.  Current methods make fibrotic lung diseases difficult to treat, even with access to a chest CT scan. In addition, the wide range of varied prognoses create issues organizing clinical trials. Finally, patients suffer extreme anxiety\u2014in addition to fibrosis-related symptoms\u2014from the disease\u2019s opaque path of progression. Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC) is a not-for-profit, co-operative effort between academia, industry and philanthropy. The group enables rapid advances in the fight against Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), and other respiratory diseases, including emphysematous conditions. Its mission is to bring together radiologists, clinicians and computational scientists from around the world to improve imaging-based treatments. In this competition, you\u2019ll predict a patient\u2019s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. You\u2019ll determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input. If successful, patients and their families would better understand their prognosis when they are first diagnosed with this incurable lung disease. Improved severity detection would also positively impact treatment trial design and accelerate the clinical development of novel treatments.  This is a Code Competition.
