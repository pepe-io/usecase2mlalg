{"title": "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge", "description": "Identify and classify toxic online commentsDiscussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments. The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google (both a part of Alphabet) are working on tools to help improve online conversation. One area of focus is the study of negative online behaviors, like toxic comments (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). So far they\u2019ve built a range of publicly available models served through the Perspective API, including toxicity. But the current models still make errors, and they don\u2019t allow users to select which types of toxicity they\u2019re interested in finding (e.g. some platforms may be fine with profanity, but not with other types of toxic content). In this competition, you\u2019re challenged to build a multi-headed model that\u2019s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective\u2019s current models. You\u2019ll be using a dataset of comments from Wikipedia\u2019s talk page edits. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful.
