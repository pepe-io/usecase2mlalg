{"title": "Northeastern SMILE Lab - Recognizing Faces in the Wild", "description": "Can you determine if two individuals are related?Do you have your father\u2019s nose?  Blood relatives often share facial features. Now researchers at Northeastern University want to improve their algorithm for facial image classification to bridge the gap between research and other familial markers like DNA results. That will be your challenge in this new Kaggle competition. An automatic kinship classifier has been in the works at Northeastern since 2010. Yet this technology remains largely unseen in practice for a couple of reasons: 1. Existing image databases for kinship recognition tasks aren't large enough to capture and reflect the true data distributions of the families of the world. 2. Many hidden factors affect familial facial relationships, so a more discriminant model is needed than the computer vision algorithms used most often for higher-level categorizations (e.g. facial recognition or object classification). In this competition, you\u2019ll help researchers build a more complex model by determining if two people are blood-related based solely on images of their faces. If you think you can get it \"on the nose,\" this competition is for you.  The SMILE Lab at Northeastern focuses on the frontier research of applied machine learning, social media analytics, human-computer interaction, and high-level image and video understanding. Their research is driven by the explosion of diverse multimedia from the Internet, including both personal and publicly-available photos and videos. They start by treating fundamental theory from learning algorithms as the soul of machine intelligence and arm it with visual perception.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild", "tags": ["DL"], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host": "kaggle.com", "date_project": "2019-08-09 01:59:00", "words": 248, "sentences": 14, "sum_nltk": "Can you determine if two individuals are related?Do you have your father\u2019s nose?\nNow researchers at Northeastern University want to improve their algorithm for facial image classification to bridge the gap between research and other familial markers like DNA results.\nAn automatic kinship classifier has been in the works at Northeastern since 2010.\nExisting image databases for kinship recognition tasks aren't large enough to capture and reflect the true data distributions of the families of the world.\n2.
