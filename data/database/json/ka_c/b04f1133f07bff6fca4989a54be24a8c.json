{"title": "Two Sigma Financial Modeling Challenge", "description": "Can you uncover predictive value in an uncertain world?How can we use the world\u2019s tools and intelligence to forecast economic outcomes that can never be entirely predictable? This question is at the core of countless economic activities around the world \u2013 including at Two Sigma Investments, who\u00a0has been applying technology and systematic strategies to financial trading since 2001. For over 15 years, Two Sigma has been at the forefront of applying technology and data science to financial forecasts. While their pioneering advances in big data, AI, and machine learning in the financial world have been pushing the industry forward, as with all other scientific progress, they are driven to make continual progress. Through this exclusive partnership, Two Sigma is excited to explore what untapped value Kaggle's diverse\u00a0data science community can discover in the financial markets. Economic opportunity depends on the ability to deliver singularly accurate forecasts in a world of uncertainty. By accurately predicting financial movements, Kagglers will learn about scientifically-driven approaches to\u00a0unlocking\u00a0significant predictive capability.\u00a0Two Sigma is excited to find predictive value and gain a better understanding of the skills\u00a0offered by the global data science crowd. What is a Code Competition? Welcome to Kaggle's very first Code Competition! In contrast to our traditional competitions, where competitors submit only prediction outputs, participants in\u00a0Code Competitions\u00a0will submit their code via Kaggle Kernels. All kernels are private by default in Code Competitions. You\u00a0can\u00a0build your models in Kernels by running them on a training set and, once\u00a0you're ready to submit your code, your\u00a0model's performance will be evaluated against the test set and your score and public leaderboard position revealed. As with our traditional competitions, we\u00a0still maintain a private leaderboard test set, which your code is also evaluated against for final scoring, but is\u00a0not\u00a0revealed until the competition closes. Since Code Competitions are brand new, we ask for your patience if you encounter bugs or frustrating platform quirks. Please report any issues you find in the forums and we'll do our best to respond. Who owns my code? You do. Even though you are submitting code, the intellectual property exchange here works similarly to a standard prediction competition, whereby prize winners have the option to grant a non-exclusive license in exchange for a prize. There is a new addition to the terms for Code Competitions: Kaggle and the competition host reserve a right to review submissions \"for purposes related to evaluation and scoring in this Competition, including but not limited to the assessment of potential cheating behavior.\" Please refer to the official competition rules for full details. Getting Started  Review the data page\u00a0for details about the data and the evaluation metric. You may\u00a0download\u00a0the train set for local training. Take a look at the tutorial covering the\u00a0new code submission process under\u00a0the submission instructions tab. You'll find step-by-step instructions,\u00a0some helpful pointers, plus details on environment constraints. Get feedback on your\u00a0benchmark code and share exploratory analyses with the community by making any of your kernels public. Improve your score!  Note: there is no cost of entry for participation.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling", "tags": [], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host":
