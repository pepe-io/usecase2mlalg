{"title": "Humpback Whale Identification", "description": "Can you identify a whale by its tail?After centuries of intense whaling, recovering whale populations still have a hard time adapting to warming oceans and struggle to compete every day with the industrial fishing industry for food. To aid whale conservation efforts, scientists use photo surveillance systems to monitor ocean activity. They use the shape of whales\u2019 tails and unique markings found in footage to identify what species of whale they\u2019re analyzing and meticulously log whale pod dynamics and movements. For the past 40 years, most of this work has been done manually by individual scientists, leaving a huge trove of data untapped and underutilized. In this competition, you\u2019re challenged to build an algorithm to identify individual whales in images. You\u2019ll analyze Happywhale\u2019s database of over 25,000 images, gathered from research institutions and public contributors. By contributing, you\u2019ll help to open rich fields of understanding for marine mammal population dynamics around the globe. Note, this competition is similar in nature to this competition  with an expanded and updated dataset.  We'd like to thank Happywhale  for providing this data and problem.
