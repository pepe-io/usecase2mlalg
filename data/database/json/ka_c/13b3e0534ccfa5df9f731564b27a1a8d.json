{"title": "Zillow Prize: Zillow\u2019s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate)", "description": "Can you improve the algorithm that changed the world of real estate?Zillow\u2019s Zestimate home valuation has shaken up the U.S. real estate industry since first released 11 years ago. A home is often the largest and most expensive purchase a person makes in his or her lifetime. Ensuring homeowners have a trusted way to monitor this asset is incredibly important. The Zestimate was created to give consumers as much information as possible about homes and the housing market, marking the first time consumers had access to this type of home value information at no cost. \u201cZestimates\u201d are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property.   And, by continually improving the median margin of error (from 14% at the onset to 5% today), Zillow has since become established as one of the largest, most trusted marketplaces for real estate information in the U.S. and a leading example of impactful machine learning. Zillow Prize, a competition with a one million dollar grand prize, is challenging the data science community to help push the accuracy of the Zestimate even further. Winning algorithms stand to impact the home values of  110M homes across the U.S. In this million-dollar competition, participants will develop an algorithm that makes predictions about the future sale prices of homes. The contest is structured into two rounds, the qualifying round which opens May 24, 2017 and the private round for the 100 top qualifying teams that opens  on Feb 1st, 2018. In the qualifying round, you\u2019ll be building a model to improve the Zestimate residual error. In the final round, you\u2019ll build a home valuation algorithm from the ground up, using external data sources to help engineer new features that give your model an edge over the competition. Because real estate transaction data is public information, there will be a three-month sales tracking period after each competition round closes where your predictions will be evaluated against the actual sale prices of the homes. The final leaderboard won\u2019t be revealed until the close of the sales tracking period.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1", "tags": ["Ensembling", "Feature Engineering", "Xgboost", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "CLustering"], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host": "kaggle.com", "date_project": "2018-01-10 16:59:00", "words": 354, "sentences": 16, "sum_nltk": "\u201cZestimates\u201d are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property.\nAnd, by continually improving the median margin of error (from 14% at the onset to 5% today), Zillow has since become established as one of the largest, most trusted marketplaces for real estate information in the U.S. and a leading example of impactful machine learning.\nZillow Prize, a competition with a one million dollar grand prize, is challenging the data science community to help push the accuracy of the Zestimate even further.\nWinning algorithms stand to impact the home values of  110M homes across the U.S. In this million-dollar competition, participants will develop an algorithm that makes predictions about the future sale prices of homes.\nIn the qualifying round, you\u2019ll be building a model to improve the Zestimate residual error.\nIn the final round, you\u2019ll build a home valuation algorithm from the ground up, using external data sources to help engineer new features that give your model an edge over the competition.\nBecause real estate transaction data is public information, there will be a three-month sales tracking period after each competition round closes where your predictions will be evaluated against the actual sale prices of the homes.", "sum_nltk_words": 205, "sum_nltk_runtime": 0.004, "sum_t5": "the algorithm that changed the world of real estate has shaken up the industry. the algorithm was created to give consumers as much information as possible about homes and the housing market. the median margin of error has been improved from 14% at the onset to 5% today. the algorithm is now a leading example of impactful machine learning. the final leaderboard won\u2019t be revealed until the close of the sales tracking period. the algorithm will be used to predict the future sale prices of 110M homes across the u.s", "sum_t5_words": 90, "sum_t5_runtime": 6.748, "runtime": 0.003, "nltk_category": "Finance", "nltk_category_score": 0.30752384662628174, "nltk_category_runtime": 19.253, "nltk_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "nltk_subcategory_score": 0.9794425368309021, "nltk_subcategory_runtime": 30.336, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.30752384662628174, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.9794425368309021, "runtime_cat": 49.59, "engagement_score": "0.709", "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999978009847118", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "improve algorithm changed world real estatezillows zestimate home valuation shaken u real estate industry since first released 11 year ago home often largest expensive purchase person make lifetime ensuring homeowner trusted way monitor asset incredibly important zestimate created give consumer much information possible home housing market marking first time consumer access type home value information cost zestimates estimated home value based 75 million statistical machine learning model analyze hundred data point property continually improving median margin error 14 onset 5 today zillow since become established one largest trusted marketplace real estate information u leading example impactful machine learning zillow prize competition one million dollar grand prize challenging data science community help push accuracy zestimate even winning algorithm stand impact home value 110m home across u milliondollar competition participant develop algorithm make prediction future sale price home contest structured two round qualifying round open may 24 2017 private round 100 top qualifying team open feb 1st 2018 qualifying round youll building model improve zestimate residual error final round youll build home valuation algorithm ground using external data source help engineer new feature give model edge competition real estate transaction data public information threemonth sale tracking period competition round close prediction evaluated actual sale price home final leaderboard wont revealed close sale tracking period", "tags_descriptive": ["Ensembling", "Feature Engineering", "Xgboost", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "CLustering"]}
