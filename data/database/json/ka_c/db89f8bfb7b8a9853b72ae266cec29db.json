{"title": "Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn", "description": "Use Google's Word2Vec for movie reviewsIn this tutorial competition, we dig a little \"deeper\" into sentiment analysis. Google's Word2Vec\u00a0is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning\u00a0and semantic relationships among words. It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but is computationally more efficient. This tutorial focuses on Word2Vec for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a challenging subject in machine learning. People express their emotions in language that is often obscured by sarcasm, ambiguity, and plays on words, all of which could be very misleading for both humans and computers. There's another Kaggle competition\u00a0for movie review sentiment analysis. In this tutorial we explore how Word2Vec can be applied to a similar problem. Deep learning has been in the news a lot over the past few years, even making it to the front page of the New York Times. These machine learning\u00a0techniques, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and made possible by recent advances in computing power, have been making waves via\u00a0breakthrough results in image recognition, speech processing, and natural language tasks. Recently, deep learning approaches won several Kaggle competitions, including a drug discovery\u00a0task, and\u00a0cat and dog image recognition. Tutorial Overview This tutorial will\u00a0help you get started with Word2Vec for natural language processing. It\u00a0has two goals:\u00a0 Basic Natural Language Processing:\u00a0Part 1 of this tutorial is intended for beginners and covers basic natural language processing\u00a0techniques, which are needed for later parts of the tutorial. Deep Learning for Text\u00a0Understanding: In\u00a0Parts 2 and 3, we delve into how to train a model\u00a0using Word2Vec and how to use the resulting word vectors\u00a0for sentiment analysis. Since deep learning is a rapidly evolving field, large amounts of\u00a0the work has not yet been published, or exists only as\u00a0academic papers. Part 3 of the\u00a0tutorial is more exploratory than prescriptive -- we experiment with several ways of using Word2Vec rather than giving you a recipe for using the output. To achieve these goals, we rely on an\u00a0IMDB sentiment analysis data set, which has 100,000 multi-paragraph movie reviews, both positive and negative.\u00a0 Acknowledgements This dataset was collected in association with the following publication: Andrew L.
