{"title": "Google AI Open Images - Object Detection Track", "description": "Detect objects in varied and complex images.Introduction Google AI (Google\u2019s AI research arm, tasked with advancing AI for everyone) is challenging you to build an algorithm that detects objects automatically using an absolutely massive training dataset \u2015 one with more varied and complex bounding-box annotations and object classes than ever before. Here's the background. Computers are getting better and better at vision. But in a few critical ways, they still can't match a human\u2019s intuitive perception. For example, what do you see when you look at this photo?  Most of us would answer, \u201ca sandy beach, the ocean, a few people walking, some trees, grass, and buildings\u2026a woman walking her dog right there! Oh yeah, and there is a man holding a plastic cup.\u201d Can a computer provide as precise an image description? Google AI wants to further push the capabilities of computer vision. We hope that providing very large training set will stimulate research into more sophisticated object and relationship detection models that will exceed current state-of-the-art performance. The results of this Challenge will be presented at a workshop at the European Conference on Computer Vision 2018.  Object Detection Track Object detection is a central task in computer vision, with applications ranging across search, robotics, self-driving cars, and many others.  As deep network solutions become deeper and more complex, they are often limited by the amount of training data available. With this in mind, to spur advances in analyzing and understanding images, Google AI has publicly released the Open Images dataset.  Open Images follows the tradition of PASCAL VOC, ImageNet and COCO, now at an unprecedented scale. The Open Images Challenge is based on Open Images dataset. The training set of the Challenge contains:  12M bounding-box annotations for 500 object classes on 1.7M training images Images of complex scenes with several objects\u2013an average of 7 boxes per image Highly varied images that contain brand new objects like \u201cfedora\u201d and \u201csnowman\u201d Class hierarchy that reflects the relationships between classes of Open Images.   In this track of the Challenge, you are asked to build the best performing algorithm for automatically detecting objects.  Please refer to the Open Images Challenge page for additional details on the dataset. In addition to this Object Detection track, the Challenge also includes a Visual Relationship Detection track to detect pairs of objects in particular relations, e.g. \"woman playing guitar,\" \"beer on table,\" \"dog inside car\", \"man holding coffee\", etc. The Visual Relationship Detection track is available here.
