{"title": "LANL Earthquake Prediction", "description": "Can you predict upcoming laboratory earthquakes?Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be. In this competition, you will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, you\u2019ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data.  If this challenge is solved and the physics are ultimately shown to scale from the laboratory to the field, researchers will have the potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure. This challenge is hosted by  Los Alamos National Laboratory which enhances national security by ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, developing technologies to reduce threats from weapons of mass destruction, and solving problems related to energy, environment, infrastructure, health, and global security concerns.
