{"title": "Elo Merchant Category Recommendation", "description": "Help understand customer loyaltyImagine being hungry in an unfamiliar part of town and getting restaurant recommendations served up, based on your personal preferences, at just the right moment. The recommendation comes with an attached discount from your credit card provider for a local place around the corner! Right now, Elo, one of the largest payment brands in Brazil, has built partnerships with merchants in order to offer promotions or discounts to cardholders. But do these promotions work for either the consumer or the merchant? Do customers enjoy their experience? Do merchants see repeat business? Personalization is key.  Elo has built machine learning models to understand the most important aspects and preferences in their customers\u2019 lifecycle, from food to shopping. But so far none of them is specifically tailored for an individual or profile. This is where you come in. In this competition, Kagglers will develop algorithms to identify and serve the most relevant opportunities to individuals, by uncovering signal in customer loyalty. Your input will improve customers\u2019 lives and help Elo reduce unwanted campaigns, to create the right experience for customers.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation", "tags": ["Feature Engineering", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Regression", "Recommender"], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host": "kaggle.com", "date_project": "2019-02-27 00:59:00", "words": 182, "sentences": 8, "runtime": 0.003, "description_category": "Accommodation & Food", "description_category_score": 0.8035790324211121, "description_category_runtime": 15.186, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.8974841833114624, "description_subcategory_runtime": 24.169, "category": "Accommodation & Food", "category_score": 0.8035790324211121, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.8974841833114624, "runtime_cat": 39.355, "engagement_score": "0.713", "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.9999971141931219", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "help understand customer loyaltyimagine hungry unfamiliar part town getting restaurant recommendation served based personal preference right moment recommendation come attached discount credit card provider local place around corner right elo one largest payment brand brazil built partnership merchant order offer promotion discount cardholder promotion work either consumer merchant customer enjoy experience merchant see repeat business personalization key elo built machine learning model understand important aspect preference customer lifecycle food shopping far none specifically tailored individual profile come competition kagglers develop algorithm identify serve relevant opportunity individual uncovering signal customer loyalty input improve customer life help elo reduce unwanted campaign create right experience customer", "tags_descriptive": ["Feature Engineering", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Regression", "Recommender"]}
