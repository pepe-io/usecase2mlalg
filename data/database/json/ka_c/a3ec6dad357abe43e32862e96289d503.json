{"title": "Google Cloud & YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge", "description": "Can you produce the best video tag predictions?Video captures a cross-section of our society. And major advances in analyzing and understanding video have the potential to touch all aspects of life from learning and communication to entertainment and play. In this competition, Google is inviting the Kaggle community to join efforts to accelerate research in large-scale video understanding, while giving participants access to the Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine. Today, one of the greatest obstacles to rapid improvements in video understanding research has been the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets open to the public. For example, the availability of large, labeled datasets such as ImageNet\u00a0has enabled continued breakthroughs in machine learning and machine perception. To that end, Google\u2019s recent release of the YouTube-8M (YT-8M) dataset\u00a0represents a significant step in this direction. Making this resource open to everyone from students and industry professionals is expected to kickstart innovation in areas such as representation learning and video modeling architectures. In this competition, you are challenged to develop classification algorithms which accurately assign video-level labels using the new and improved YT-8M V2 dataset. The dataset was created from over 7 million YouTube videos (450,000 hours of video) and includes video labels from a vocabulary of 4716 classes (3.4 labels/video on average).  It also comes with pre-extracted audio & visual features from every second of video (3.2B feature vectors in total). By taking part, Kagglers will not only play a pivotal role in setting state-of-the-art benchmarks, but also improve search and organization of video archives.  Getting Started  Review the data\u00a0page for special instructions\u00a0on how\u00a0to access the competition's data.\u00a0It will be hosted on Google Cloud. Participants have the option to download the data to work locally or work within the Google Cloud ML beta Platform. Review the tutorial on Getting Started with Google Cloud, and try the starter code.  Sign up for a Google Cloud ML Platform free trial account. The free trial account includes $300 in credits!   We've also provided a subsample of the data to explore on Kernels. Take a look at this Python notebook and create your own. Don't forget to review the prize eligibility details, which includes requirements for code open-sourcing and a paper submission.  Because Cloud ML is currently a beta product, Google\u00a0welcomes the opportunity to hear your feedback about using the tool. Please share your questions and thoughts on the competition's forums. Additional resources specific to the YT-8M dataset and Google Cloud ML can be found here.
