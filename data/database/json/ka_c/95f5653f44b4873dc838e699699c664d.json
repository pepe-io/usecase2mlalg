{"title": "Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification", "description": "Predict attribute labels for restaurants using user-submitted photosDoes your favorite Ethiopian restaurant\u00a0take reservations? Will a\u00a0first date at that authentic\u00a0looking bistro break your wallet?\u00a0Is the\u00a0diner down the street a good call for breakfast?\u00a0Restaurant\u00a0labels\u00a0help Yelp users quickly answer questions like these, narrowing down their results to only restaurants\u00a0that fit their nuanced needs. In this competition, Yelp is challenging Kagglers to build a model that automatically tags restaurants with multiple labels\u00a0using\u00a0a dataset of user-submitted photos. Currently, restaurant labels are manually selected\u00a0by Yelp users\u00a0when they submit a review. Selecting the labels is optional, leaving some restaurants un- or only partially-categorized.\u00a0 In an age of food selfies and photo-centric social storytelling, it may be no surprise to hear that\u00a0Yelp's users\u00a0upload an enormous amount\u00a0of photos every day alongside their written reviews. Can you turn their pictures into (less than a thousand) words?
