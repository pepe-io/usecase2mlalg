{"title": "Google Cloud & NCAA\u00ae ML Competition 2018-Men's", "description": "Apply Machine Learning to NCAA\u00ae March Madness\u00aeGoogle Cloud and NCAA\u00ae have teamed up to bring you this year\u2019s version of the Kaggle machine learning competition. Another year, another chance to anticipate the upsets, call the probabilities, and put your bracketology skills to the leaderboard test. Kagglers will join the millions of fans who attempt to forecast the outcomes of March Madness\u00ae during this year's NCAA Division I Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Basketball Championships. But unlike most fans, you will pick your bracket using a combination of NCAA\u2019s historical data and your computing power, while the ground truth unfolds on national television.   In the first stage of the competition, Kagglers will rely on results of past tournaments to build and test models. We encourage you to post any useful external data as a dataset. In the second stage, competitors will forecast outcomes of all possible match-ups in the 2018 NCAA Division I Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Basketball Championships. You don't need to participate in the first stage to enter the second. The first stage exists to incentivize model building and provide a means to score predictions. The real competition is forecasting the 2018 results. This page is for the NCAA Division I Men's tournament.
