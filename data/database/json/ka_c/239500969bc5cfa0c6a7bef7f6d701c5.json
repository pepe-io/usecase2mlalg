{"title": "CareerCon 2019 - Help Navigate Robots", "description": "Compete to get your resume in front of our sponsorsCareerCon 2019 is upon us! CareerCon is a digital event all about landing your first data science job \u2014 and registration is now open! Ahead of the event, we have a fun competition to get you started. See below for a unique challenge and opportunity to share your resume with select CareerCon sponsors.  ___________________________________ The Competition Robots are smart\u2026 by design. To fully understand and properly navigate a task, however, they need input about their environment. In this competition, you\u2019ll help robots recognize the floor surface they\u2019re standing on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors). We\u2019ve collected IMU sensor data while driving a small mobile robot over different floor surfaces on the university premises. The task is to predict which one of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete) the robot is on using sensor data such as acceleration and velocity. Succeed and you'll help improve the navigation of robots without assistance across many different surfaces, so they won\u2019t fall down on the job.  Special thanks for making this competition possible: The data for this competition has been collected by Heikki Huttunen and Francesco Lomio from the Department of Signal Processing and Damoon Mohamadi, Kaan Celikbilek, Pedram Ghazi and Reza Ghabcheloo from the Department of Automation and Mechanical   Engineering both from Tampere University, Finland.
