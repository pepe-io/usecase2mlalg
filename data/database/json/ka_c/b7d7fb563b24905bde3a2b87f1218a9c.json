{"title": "COVID19 Global Forecasting (Week 2)", "description": "Forecast daily COVID-19 spread in regions around worldThis week 2 forecasting task is now closed for submissions. Click here to visit the week 3 version, and make a submission there. This is week 2 of Kaggle's COVID19 forecasting series, following the Week 1 competition. This is the 2nd of at least 4 competitions we plan to launch in this series. Background The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle)  to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\u2019s (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Challenge Kaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It\u2019s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19. You are encouraged to pull in, curate and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your finding in a notebook.  As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.  Companies and Organizations There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle\u2019s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community. Acknowledgements JHU CSSE for making the data available to the public.
