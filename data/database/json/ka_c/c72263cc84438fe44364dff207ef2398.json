Each datapoint describes two individuals, A and B. For each person, 11 p The binary label represents a human judgement about which one of the two individuals is more influential. A label '1' means A is more influential than B. 0 means B is more influential than A. The goal of the challenge is to train a machine learning model which, for pairs of individuals, predicts the human judgement on who is more influential with high accuracy.\u00a0Labels for the dataset have been collected by PeerIndex\u00a0using an application similar to the one described in this post.
