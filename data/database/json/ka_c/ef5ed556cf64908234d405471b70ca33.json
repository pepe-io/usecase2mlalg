{"title": "Restaurant Revenue Prediction", "description": "Predict annual restaurant sales based on objective measurementsWith over 1,200 quick service restaurants across the globe, TFI\u00a0is the company behind some of the world's most well-known brands: Burger King, Sbarro, Popeyes, Usta Donerci, and Arby\u2019s. They employ over 20,000 people in\u00a0Europe and Asia and make significant daily investments in developing new restaurant sites. Right now, deciding when and where to open new restaurants is largely a subjective process based on the personal judgement and experience\u00a0of\u00a0development teams. This subjective data\u00a0is\u00a0difficult to accurately extrapolate across geographies and cultures.\u00a0 New restaurant sites take large investments of time and capital to get up and running. When the wrong location for a restaurant brand is chosen, the site closes within 18 months and operating losses are incurred.\u00a0 Finding a mathematical model to increase the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites would allow TFI\u00a0to invest more in other important business areas, like sustainability, innovation, and training for\u00a0new employees.\u00a0Using demographic, real estate, and commercial data, this competition challenges you to predict the annual restaurant\u00a0sales of 100,000 regional locations. TFI\u00a0would love to hire an expert Kaggler like you to head\u00a0up their growing data science team in Istanbul or Shanghai.
