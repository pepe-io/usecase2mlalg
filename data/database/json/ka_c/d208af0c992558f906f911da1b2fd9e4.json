{"title": "Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge", "description": "Can you automatically suggest product prices to online sellers?It can be hard to know how much something\u2019s really worth. Small details can mean big differences in pricing. For example, one of these sweaters cost $335 and the other cost $9.99. Can you guess which one\u2019s which?   Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.  Mercari, Japan\u2019s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They\u2019d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace. In this competition, Mercari\u2019s challenging you to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices. You\u2019ll be provided user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition. Note that, because of the public nature of this data, this competition is a \u201cKernels Only\u201d competition.
