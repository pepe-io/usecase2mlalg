{"title": "Nomad2018 Predicting Transparent Conductors", "description": "Predict the key properties of novel transparent semiconductorsInnovative materials design is needed to tackle some of the most important health, environmental, energy, social, and economic challenges of this century. In particular, improving the properties of materials that are intrinsically connected to the generation and utilization of energy is crucial if we are to mitigate environmental damage due to a growing global demand. Transparent conductors\u00a0are an important class of compounds that are both electrically conductive and have a low absorption in the visible range, which are typically competing properties. A combination of both of these characteristics is key for the operation of a variety of technological devices such as photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes for flat-panel displays, transistors, sensors, touch screens, and lasers. However, only a small number of compounds are currently known to display both transparency and conductivity suitable enough to be used as transparent conducting materials.  Aluminum\u00a0(Al), gallium\u00a0(Ga), indium\u00a0(In) sesquioxides are some of the most promising transparent conductors because of a combination of both large\u00a0bandgap\u00a0energies, which leads to optical transparency over the visible range, and high\u00a0conductivities. These materials are also chemically stable and relatively inexpensive to produce. Alloying of these binary compounds in ternary or quaternary mixtures could enable the design of a new material at a specific composition with improved properties over what is current possible. These alloys are described by the formula (AlxGayInz)2NO3N; where x, y, and z can vary but are limited by the constraint x+y+z = 1.
