{"title": "Open Images Instance Segmentation RVC 2020 edition", "description": "Outline segmentation masks of objects in imagesIntroduction Computer vision has advanced considerably but is still challenged in matching the precision of human perception. Open Images is a collaborative release of ~9 million images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, visual relationships, and localized narratives. This uniquely large and diverse dataset is designed to spur state of the art advances in analyzing and understanding images. This year the Open Images  Instance Segmentation competition is a part of the larger Robust Vision Challenge 2020. This challenge encourages the participants to develop robust computer vision algorithms able to perform well across multiple datasets. Please refer to the RVC 2020 page and the Open Images Challenge page for more details.  Participants are also welcome to submit to this playground competition beyond the context of RVC. Instance Segmentation Track In this track of the Challenge, you are asked to provide segmentation masks of objects. This track\u2019s training set represents 2.1M segmentation masks for object instances in 300 categories; with a validation set containing an additional 23k masks. The train set masks were produced by our state-of-the-art interactive segmentation process, where professional human annotators iteratively correct the output of a segmentation neural network. The validation and test set masks have been annotated manually with a strong focus on quality.   Example train set annotations. Left: Wuxi science park, 1995 by Gary Stevens.
