{"title": "Facebook Recruiting III - Keyword Extraction", "description": "Identify keywords and tags from millions of text questionsLooking for a data science position at Facebook? \u00a0After two successful prior Kaggle competitions, Facebook continues their mission to identify the best data scientists and software engineers that Kaggle has to offer. In this third installment, they seek candidates who have experience text mining large amounts of data.  This competition tests your text skills on a large dataset from the Stack Exchange sites. \u00a0The task is to predict the tags (a.k.a. keywords, topics, summaries), given only the question text and its title. The dataset contains content from disparate stack exchange sites, containing a mix of both technical and non-technical questions.  Positions are available in Menlo Park, Seattle, New York City, and London; candidates must have, or be eligible to obtain, authorization to work in the US or UK. Please note: you must compete as an individual in recruiting competitions. You may only use the data provided to make your predictions. Crawling stack exchange sites to look up answers is not permitted.\u00a0Facebook will review the code of the top participants before deciding whether to offer an interview.\u00a0 This competition counts towards rankings & achievements. \u00a0If you wish to be considered for an interview at Facebook, check the box \"Allow host to contact me\" when you make your first entry.
