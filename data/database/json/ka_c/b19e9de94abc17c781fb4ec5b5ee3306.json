{"title": "Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction", "description": "Can you identify which households have the highest need for social welfare assistance?The Inter-American Development Bank is asking the Kaggle community for help with income qualification for some of the world's poorest families. Are you up for the challenge?   Here's the backstory: Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It\u2019s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world\u2019s poorest typically can\u2019t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.   In Latin America, one popular method uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. It\u2019s called the Proxy Means Test (or PMT). With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family\u2019s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling, or the assets found in the home to classify them and predict their level of need. While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region\u2019s population grows and poverty declines. To improve on PMT, the IDB (the largest source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean) has turned to the Kaggle community. They believe that new methods beyond traditional econometrics, based on a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, might help improve PMT\u2019s performance. Beyond Costa Rica, many countries face this same problem of inaccurately assessing social need. If Kagglers can generate an improvement, the new algorithm could be implemented in other countries around the world.
