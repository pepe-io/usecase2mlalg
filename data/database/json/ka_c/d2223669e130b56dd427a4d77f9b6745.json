{"title": "The 2nd YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge", "description": "Can you create a constrained-size model to predict video labels?The world is generating and consuming an enormous amount of video content. Currently on YouTube, people watch over 1 billion hours of video every single day. To spur advances in analyzing and understanding video,  Google AI has publicly released a large-scale video dataset that consists of millions of YouTube video features and associated labels from a diverse vocabulary of 3,700+ visual entities called the YouTube-8M Dataset. Last year, we successfully hosted Google Cloud & YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge, with 742 participating teams with 946 individual competitors from 60 countries. This competition is the second Kaggle competition based on YouTube 8M dataset, and is focused on learning video representation under budget constraints.  For a lot of video tasks where there are a large number of classes, like recommending new videos or automatic video classification, compact models need to meet memory and computational requirements. This is true even if working in cloud computational environments. Also, compact models make it possible to have limited-memory or catalog indexes on devices in order to do personalized and privacy-preserving computation on user\u2019s personal mobile phones. In this competition, you\u2019re challenged to produce a compact video classification model. Your model size must not exceed 1 GB (this is strictly enforced, through model upload). We encourage participants to train a model that most efficiently uses this budget, rather than ensembles of lots of models.  This competition is being hosted by Google AI (previously known as Google Research) as a part of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2018 selected workshop session.
