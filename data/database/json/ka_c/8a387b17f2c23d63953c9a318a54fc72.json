{"title": "Forest Cover Type Prediction", "description": "Use cartographic variables to classify forest categoriesGet started on this competition with\u00a0Kaggle Scripts.\u00a0No data download or local environment needed! Random forests?\u00a0Cover trees?\u00a0Not so fast, computer nerds. We're talking about the real thing. In this competition you are asked to predict the forest cover type (the predominant\u00a0kind\u00a0of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. Independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type. This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.
