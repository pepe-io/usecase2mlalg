{"title": "iMaterialist (Fashion) 2019 at FGVC6", "description": "Fine-grained segmentation task for fashion and apparelDesigners know what they are creating, but what, and how, do people really wear their products? What combinations of products are people using? In this competition, we challenge you to develop algorithms that will help with an important step towards automatic product detection \u2013 to accurately assign segmentations and attribute labels for fashion images.  Visual analysis of clothing is a topic that has received increasing attention in recent years. Being able to recognize apparel products and associated attributes from pictures could enhance the shopping experience for consumers, and increase work efficiency for fashion professionals. We present a new clothing dataset with the goal of introducing a novel fine-grained segmentation task by joining forces between the fashion and computer vision communities. The proposed task unifies both categorization and segmentation of rich and complete apparel attributes, an important step toward real-world applications.   While early work in computer vision addressed related clothing recognition tasks, these are not designed with fashion insiders\u2019 needs in mind, possibly due to the research gap in fashion design and computer vision. To address this, we first propose a fashion taxonomy built by fashion experts, informed by product description from the internet. To capture the complex structure of fashion objects and ambiguity in descriptions obtained from crawling the web, our standardized taxonomy contains 46 apparel objects (27 main apparel items and 19 apparel parts), and 92 related fine-grained attributes. Secondly, a total of 50K clothing images (10K with both segmentation and fine-grained attributes, 40K with apparel instance segmentation) in daily-life, celebrity events, and online shopping are labeled by both domain experts and crowd workers for fine-grained segmentation. Individuals/Teams with top submissions will be invited to present their work live at the FGVC6 workshop at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2019 Checkout the iMaterialist-Fashion Competition Github repo for the specifics of the dataset.
