{"title": "Santander Product Recommendation", "description": "Can you pair products with people?Ready to make a downpayment on your first house? Or looking to leverage the equity in the home you have? To support needs for a range of\u00a0financial decisions, Santander Bank\u00a0offers a lending hand to their customers through personalized product recommendations.  Under their current system, a small number of Santander\u2019s customers receive many recommendations while many others rarely see any resulting in an uneven customer experience. In their second competition, Santander is challenging Kagglers to predict which products their existing customers will use in the next month based on their past behavior and that of similar customers. With a more effective recommendation system in place, Santander can better meet the individual needs of all customers and ensure their satisfaction no matter where they are in life.
