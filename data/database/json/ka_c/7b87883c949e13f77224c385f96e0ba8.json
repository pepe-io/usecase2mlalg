{"title": "Open Images 2019 - Object Detection", "description": "Detect objects in varied and complex imagesIntroduction Computer vision has advanced considerably but is still challenged in matching the precision of human perception. Open Images is a collaborative release of ~9 million images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, and visual relationships. This uniquely large and diverse dataset is designed to spur state of the art advances in analyzing and understanding images. This year\u2019s Open Images V5 release enabled the second Open Images Challenge to include the following 3 tracks:  Object detection track for detecting bounding boxes around object instances, relaunched from 2018. Visual relationship detection track for detecting pairs of objects in particular relations, also relaunched from 2018. Instance segmentation track for segmenting masks of objects in images, brand new for 2019.  Google AI hopes that having a single dataset with unified annotations for image classification, object detection, visual relationship detection, and instance segmentation will stimulate progress towards genuine scene understanding. Object Detection Track In this track of the Challenge, you are asked to predict a tight bounding box around object instances. The training set contains 12.2M bounding-boxes across 500 categories on 1.7M images. The boxes have been largely manually drawn by professional annotators to ensure accuracy and consistency. The images are very diverse and often contain complex scenes with several objects (7 per image on average).   Example annotations. Left: Mark Paul Gosselaar plays the guitar by Rhys A.

The challenge contains a total of 3 tracks, which are linked above in the introduction. You are invited to explore and enter as many tracks as interest you. The results of this Challenge will be presented at a workshop at the International Conference on Computer Vision. We are excited to partner with Open Images for this second year of competitions.
