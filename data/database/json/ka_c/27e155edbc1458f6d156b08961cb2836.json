{"title": "Integer Sequence Learning", "description": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7?!7. You read that correctly. That's the start to a real integer sequence, the powers of primes. Want something easier? How about the next number in\u00a00, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55? If you answered 89, you may enjoy this challenge. Your computer may find it considerably\u00a0less enjoyable. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences\u00a0is a 50+ year effort by mathematicians the world over to catalog sequences of integers. If it has a pattern, it's probably in the OEIS, and probably described with amazing detail. This competition\u00a0challenges you create a machine learning algorithm capable of guessing\u00a0the next number in an integer sequence. While this sounds like pattern recognition\u00a0in its most basic form, a quick look at the data will\u00a0convince you this is anything\u00a0but\u00a0basic!
