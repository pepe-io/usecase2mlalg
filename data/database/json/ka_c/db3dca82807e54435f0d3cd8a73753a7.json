{"title": "BigQuery-Geotab Intersection Congestion", "description": "Can you predict wait times at major city intersections?We\u2019ve all been there: Stuck at a traffic light, only to be given mere seconds to pass through an intersection, behind a parade of other commuters. Imagine if you could help city planners and governments anticipate traffic hot spots ahead of time and reduce the stop-and-go stress of millions of commuters like you. Geotab provides a wide variety of aggregate datasets gathered from commercial vehicle telematics devices. Harnessing the insights from this data has the power to improve safety, optimize operations, and identify opportunities for infrastructure challenges. The dataset for this competition includes aggregate stopped vehicle information and intersection wait times. Your task is to predict congestion, based on an aggregate measure of stopping distance and waiting times, at intersections in 4 major US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago & Philadelphia.  This competition is being hosted in partnership with BigQuery, a data warehouse for manipulating, joining, and querying large scale tabular datasets. BigQuery also offers BigQuery ML, an easy way for users to create and run machine learning models to generate predictions through a SQL query interface. Kaggle recently released a BigQuery integration within our kernels notebook environment, and this starter kernel gives you a great starting point for how to use BQ & BQML. You\u2019re encouraged to use your data savvy, resourcefulness & intuition to find and join in additional external datasets that will increase your models\u2019 predictive power. Alright, stop waiting and get started! Acknowledgments  A big thanks to Geotab for providing the dataset for this competition!
