{"title": "Inclusive Images Challenge", "description": "Stress test image classifiers across new geographic distributionsMaking products that work for people all over the globe is an important value at Google AI. In the field of classification, this means developing models that work well for regions all over the world.  Today, the dataset a model is trained on greatly dictates the performance of that model. A system trained on a dataset that doesn\u2019t represent a broad range of localities could perform worse on images drawn from geographic regions underrepresented in the training data. Google and the industry at large are working to create more diverse & representative datasets. But it is also important for the field to make progress in understanding how to build models when the data available may not cover all audiences a model is meant to reach. Google AI is challenging Kagglers to develop models that are robust to blind spots that might exist in a data set, and to create image recognition systems that can perform well on test images drawn from different geographic distributions than the ones they were trained on. By finding ways to teach image classifiers to generalize to new geographic and cultural contexts, we hope the community will make even more progress in inclusive machine learning that benefits everyone, everywhere. Note: This competition is run in two stages. Refer to the FAQ for an explanation of how this works & the Timeline for specific dates.  This competition is a part of the NIPS 2018 competition track. Winners will be invited to attend and present their solutions at the workshop.
