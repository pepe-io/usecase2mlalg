{"title": "Flower Classification with TPUs", "description": "Use TPUs to classify 104 types of flowersTensor Processing Units (TPUs) are Now Available on Kaggle Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) quotas are now available on Kaggle, at no cost to you! TPUs are powerful hardware accelerators specialized in deep learning tasks. They were developed (and first used) by Google to process large image databases, such as extracting all the text from Street View. This competition is designed for you to give TPUs a try. The latest Tensorflow release (TF 2.1) was focused on TPUs and they\u2019re now supported both through the Keras high-level API and at a lower level, in models using a custom training loop. We can\u2019t wait to see how your solutions are accelerated by TPUs! The Challenge It\u2019s difficult to fathom just how vast and diverse our natural world is. There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000 species of birds, 30,000 species of fish \u2013 and astonishingly, over 400,000 different types of flowers. In this competition, you\u2019re challenged to build a machine learning model that identifies the type of flowers in a dataset of images (for simplicity, we\u2019re sticking to just over 100 types).  To get started with TPUs:  Read the TPU documentation one-pager Then jump right into the Getting Started Notebook for this competition  Quick note: a TPU is a network-connected accelerator and requires a couple extra lines in your code. Flipping the TPU switch in your notebook will not, by itself, accelerate your code.  Have Questions? Martin G\u00f6rner, Google Developer Advocate and author of Tensorflow without a PhD will be actively engaged in the competition forum.
