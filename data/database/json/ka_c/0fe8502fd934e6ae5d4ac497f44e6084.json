We are always looking for ways to help our customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals.  Our data science team is continually challenging our machine learning algorithms, working with the global data science community to make sure  we can more accurately identify new ways to solve our most common challenge, binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan? In this challenge, we invite Kagglers to help us identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem.", "link": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction", "tags": ["Classification", "Feature Engineering", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Model Explainability", "Naive Bayes", "Classification"], "kind": ["Project", "(Competition)", "(Dataset)"], "host": "kaggle.com", "date_project": "2019-04-11 01:59:00", "words": 152, "sentences": 4, "runtime": 0.0, "description_category": "Finance", "description_category_score": 0.5796027183532715, "description_category_runtime": 12.405, "description_subcategory": "Machine Learning", "description_subcategory_score": 0.7809141874313354, "description_subcategory_runtime": 19.399, "category": "Finance", "category_score": 0.5796027183532715, "subcategory": "Machine Learning", "subcategory_score": 0.7809141874313354, "runtime_cat": 31.804, "engagement_score": "0.744", "language_code": "en", "language": "english", "language_score": "0.999995514319312", "learn_score": 1, "explore_score": 0, "compete_score": 0, "description_lemmatized": "identify make transactionat santander mission help people business prosper always looking way help customer understand financial health identify product service might help achieve monetary goal data science team continually challenging machine learning algorithm working global data science community make sure accurately identify new way solve common challenge binary classification problem customer satisfied customer buy product customer pay loan challenge invite kagglers help u identify customer make specific transaction future irrespective amount money transacted data provided competition structure real data available solve problem", "tags_descriptive": ["Classification", "Feature Engineering", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Model Explainability", "Naive Bayes", "Classification"]}
