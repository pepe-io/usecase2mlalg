{"title": "Denoising Dirty Documents", "description": "Remove noise from printed textOptical Character Recognition\u00a0(OCR) is the process of getting type or handwritten documents\u00a0into\u00a0a digitized format. If you've read a classic novel on\u00a0a digital reading device or had your doctor pull up old healthcare records via the hospital computer system, you've probably benefited from OCR. OCR makes previously static content editable, searchable, and much easier to share. But, a lot of documents eager for digitization\u00a0are being held\u00a0back. Coffee stains, faded sun spots, dog-eared pages, and lot of wrinkles are keeping some printed documents offline and in the past.\u00a0 This competition challenges you to give these documents a machine learning makeover. Given a dataset of images of scanned\u00a0text that has\u00a0seen better days, you're challenged\u00a0to remove the noise. Improving the ease of\u00a0document enhancement\u00a0will help us get that\u00a0rare mathematics book on our e-reader before the\u00a0next beach vacation. We've kicked off\u00a0the fun with a few\u00a0handy scripts to get you started on the dataset.
