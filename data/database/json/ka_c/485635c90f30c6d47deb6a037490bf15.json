{"title": "Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (Kernels Only)", "description": "Classify the sentiment of sentences from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset\"There's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy, and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side.\" The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis, originally collected by Pang and Lee [1]. In their work on sentiment treebanks, Socher et al. [2] used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to create fine-grained labels for all parsed phrases in the corpus. This competition presents a chance to benchmark your sentiment-analysis ideas on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. You are asked to label phrases\u00a0on a scale of five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive. Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others make this task very challenging.  Kaggle is hosting this competition for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice. This competition was inspired by the work of Socher et al [2].\u00a0We encourage participants to explore the accompanying (and dare we say, fantastic) website that accompanies the paper: http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/ There you will find have source code, a live demo, and even an online interface to help train the model.
