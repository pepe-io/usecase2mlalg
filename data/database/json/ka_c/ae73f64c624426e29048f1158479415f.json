{"title": "2018 Data Science Bowl", "description": "Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discoverySpot Nuclei. Speed Cures. Imagine speeding up research for almost every disease, from lung cancer and heart disease to rare disorders. The 2018 Data Science Bowl offers our most ambitious mission yet: create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection. We\u2019ve all seen people suffer from diseases like cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, and diabetes. Many have seen their loved ones pass away. Think how many lives would be transformed if cures came faster. By automating nucleus detection, you could help unlock cures faster\u2014from rare disorders to the common cold. Want a snapshot about the 2018 Data Science Bowl? View this video. Why nuclei? Identifying the cells\u2019 nuclei is the starting point for most analyses because most of the human body\u2019s 30 trillion cells contain a nucleus full of DNA, the genetic code that programs each cell. Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work. By participating, teams will work to automate the process of identifying nuclei, which will  allow for more efficient drug testing, shortening the 10 years it takes for each new drug to come to market. Check out this video overview to find out more. What will participants do? Teams will create a computer model that can identify a range of nuclei across varied conditions. By observing patterns, asking questions, and building a model, participants will have a chance to push state-of-the-art technology farther.
