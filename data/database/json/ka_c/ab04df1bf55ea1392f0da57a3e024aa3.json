{"title": "Transfer Learning on Stack Exchange Tags", "description": "Predict tags from models trained on unrelated topicsWhat does physics have in common with biology, cooking, cryptography, diy, robotics, and travel? If you answered \"all pursuits are governed by the immutable laws of physics\" we'll begrudgingly give you partial\u00a0credit. If you answered \"all were chosen randomly by a scheming\u00a0Kaggle employee\u00a0for a twisted\u00a0transfer learning competition\", congratulations, we accept your answer and mark the question as solved. In this competition, we provide the titles, text, and tags of Stack Exchange questions from six different sites. We then ask for tag predictions on unseen physics questions. Solving this problem via\u00a0a\u00a0standard machine approach might\u00a0involve training an algorithm on a corpus of related text. Here, you are challenged to train on material\u00a0from outside the field. Can an\u00a0algorithm learn appropriate physics tags from \"extreme-tourism Antarctica\"? Let's find out. Kaggle is hosting this competition for the data science community to use for fun and education.
