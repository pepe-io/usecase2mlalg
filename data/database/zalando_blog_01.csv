Flair is useful when you want to understand the meanings of email messages, customer responses, website comments, or any other scenario where users submit text feedback that you want to automatically classify or otherwise process.;Flair NLP Framework
;;Wholesale & Retail;;;0.75;22.03.2017;17.01.2021;Our most recent product requires precise estimates of future interests of Zalando consumers based on their history of interacting with the fashion platform. For example, we want to predict a consumer's interest in ordering selected fashion articles. We set ourselves the goal to build a powerful and versatile prediction tool that not only fits the task at hand, but is also ready for future product developments.;0.0;;0.0;https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2017/03/deep-learning-in-production-for-predicting-consumer-behavior.html;;Machine Learning;;['Fashion', 'DL', 'RNN'];;Deep Learning in Production for Predicting Consumer Behavior

Visual search poses some interesting challenges: how to deal with variations in image quality, lighting, background, different human poses and article distortion, or finding the right product in a large database in real-time. Our working scenario so far has been to build on our home-grown FashionDNA to retrieve blazers, dresses, jumpers, shirts, skirts, trousers, t-shirts and tops in fashion images, with or without backgrounds.;Shop the Look with Deep Learning
