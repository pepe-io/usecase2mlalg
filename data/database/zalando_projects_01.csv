We currently face two obstacles in applying our models even further: (1) Models that are trained on Zalando’s highly curated shop imagery don’t generalize well to other assortments or customer produced content; and (2) Model performance is tainted by spurious correlations with confounding but irrelevant sources of information inside the Zalando image catalog. We aim to overcome both obstacles with the help of methods from adversarial learning. Implementation Challenges Adversarial learning tasks can be formulated with the help of two-player games. Here the first player’s goal is to predict a certain attribute (like the image source), while the second player’s goal is to sabotage the first player. Mathematically, this corresponds to solving saddle point optimization problems. As adversarial learning following this strategy is notoriously unstable (see the figure below for the particular challenge of “orbiting”), we plan to improve its training behaviour by refining optimization algorithms exploring 2nd order methods as well as insights from image GANs. We also plan to approach the problem by finding adversary objectives (like MMD, meta learning) that avoid the need of solving saddle point optimization problems, without unduly affecting classification ability. Learning-to-Forget Example We have an article embedding which encodes, in particular, the type of fabric, season, targeted gender and age, the color as well as the brand of a fashion item: Fashion DNA. Via adversarial learning, we trained a model on top of Fashion DNA with the task to forget all article properties except for color and pattern.

;Wholesale & Retail;;;1.0;;17.01.2021;Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) capture notions of both relevance and diversity in a principled manner. DPPs allows the system to recommend a collection of items which is diverse, while retaining relevance, thus attempting to capture different aspects of a customer’s taste and preferences.;0.0;;0.0;https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/determinantal-point-processes/;;Machine Learning;;['Fashion', 'Recommender', 'Search'];Chic, shocking, trendy, or casual, Fashion must never be monotonous. As such, diversity plays a central role in fashion. At Zalando we research such topics, focusing on elegant mathematical models named Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) that capture notions of both relevance and diversity in a principled manner. Defined over a fixed ground set image1, for example the articles in the Zalando catalogue, DPPs define a distribution over subsets of image1. By encoding negative correlations between items in the set via a kernel matrix, a DPP will assign higher probability to subsets that are diverse. At the same time DPPs can in parallel encode the relevance of each item to a specific task, via a relevance score for example, thus allowing for a trade-off between the two aspects of the task. DPPs find many applications within Zalando, Two such cases are Recommendations and Search. In Recommender Systems, it easy to become trapped in a scenario where the system recommends the same or very similar articles simply because they are individually deemed relevant. DPPs allows the system to recommend a collection of items which is diverse, while retaining relevance, thus attempting to capture different aspects of a customer’s taste and preferences. In Figure 1 we show the two different sets of recommendations, one using only a relevance score and one using a DPP to infuse diversity;Determinantal Point Processes
;Wholesale & Retail;;;1.0;;17.01.2021;To make the properties of a fashion item more accessible, we collect the array information in the catalog and map it into an abstract mathematical linear space, the fashion space. There, the item is represented by a vector, its Fashion DNA. Unlike the catalog data, Fashion DNA is a fundamentally geometrical representation: The similarity between two articles is encoded by their distance in fashion space, while article properties (is it blue? Is it a dress? Is it offered by Nike? Does customer #1,234,567 like it?) are associated with specific directions in this space.;0.0;;0.0;https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/improving-fashion-item-encoding-and-retrieval/;;Machine Learning;;['Fashion', 't-SNE', 'DNN', 'Recommender', 'Image Tagging', 'Labeling', 'Trend Revealing', 'Rank Competitors'];Unlike a brick-and-mortar department store, online retailers like Zalando must use digital representations of their offerings to entice customers. Traditionally, this takes the form of information stored in a catalog database, which collects categorical properties (tags), numerical descriptors (e.g., prices), and images of the items. Although this information is curated by in-house experts, assignments are often subjective (what makes a dress ‘dark red,’ or ‘leisure’?), and article imagery is highly stylized. It is also by no means complete. More importantly, there is no straightforward relation between these article attributes, and the properties individual customers actually care about: Does it fit? How does it feel wearing? Does it suit my style? Fashion DNA To make the properties of a fashion item more accessible, we collect the array information in the catalog and map it into an abstract mathematical linear space, the fashion space. There, the item is represented by a vector, its Fashion DNA. Unlike the catalog data, Fashion DNA is a fundamentally geometrical representation: The similarity between two articles is encoded by their distance in fashion space, while article properties (is it blue? Is it a dress? Is it offered by Nike? Does customer #1, 234, 567 like it?) are associated with specific directions in this space. Applications Linear embeddings yield access to a powerful arsenal of inference methods in the fashion universe. Generally, Fashion DNA encodings are extracted as hidden activations in a feedforward deep neural network (DNN) that is trained on a relevant target, e.g., prediction of brands and silhouettes from images, mapping images to fashion items, or prediction of customer sales from attributes and images. The resulting Fashion DNA is correspondingly optimized for different tasks. For instance, the latter setup naturally leads to an enhanced collaborative filtering recommender system for fashion. In addition to the choice of target data, we may select which input data to feed, and we have a wide latitude of neural network architectures to transform the data. Hence, we can experiment with Fashion DNA models that are tailored to specific use cases. A few prospective applications are: Image Tagging Here, the idea is to train a neural network on a set of images for an item, with the goal of predicting catalog tags (like brand, color, silhouette, etc.). During inference, feeding item images into the trained network results in a vector of probabilities for each tag, providing estimates for target groups, brand membership, color, pattern, material, etc.: There are a variety of applications beneficial to Zalando’s business, e.g., AI tagging support – tagging new additions to the online shop is a resource-intensive, error-prone, and subjective task. The algorithm can suggest tags and identify labeling mistakes and omissions. Finding fashion trends – analyzing images posted by trendsetters, influencers, and shows, one could detect fashionable styles early on. Assessing competitors’ assortments – applied on crawled images, the method can provide continuously updated insights into the strategies of other players in the online fashion sector. Information Synthesis, Inference, and Uncertainty Fashion information often is embedded in an implicit context that is easy to disentangle for a human observer with daily life experience, but presents a difficult challenge to machine learning algorithms. For instance, images may depict a model wearing a variety of fashion articles in front of a structured background, or detailed views of an item (seams, tags, brand logos, etc.) that are of particular interest to customers. It doesn’t take much effort for a human to focus on a specific element of the model outfit (the image segmentation problem), or to imagine the three-dimensional appearance of an article from a few two-dimensional snapshots. The ease at which humans go about these tasks suggests that our internal representation “engine” is not only able to aggregate the information, but also can infer missing attributes and handle uncertainty. Conventional feed-forward neural network architectures are not well equipped for the purpose, while more recent probabilistic models like variational autoencoders form a basis for developing a more powerful representation scheme. Still, even minor tweaks like changing the loss function can already render Fashion DNA much more resilient to the presentation of an item, as the map below demonstrates: Note that the model assigns similar encodings to very different views of an article (visible as clusters in the map), while still being able to extract abstract attributes like brand, silhouette, etc., with good precision. Such Fashion DNA is a useful substrate for our efforts to solve the street-to-shop task, matching fashion items depicted in real-life images to items in the online store.;Improving Fashion Item Encoding and Retrieval
;Wholesale & Retail;;;1.0;;17.01.2021;“How do I look?” – this is a question typically asked when someone tries a new type of clothing or shoe. It emphasizes that visual appearance is key to fashion. The look of fashion can even be more important than fit and size: many people are willing to trade worse fit with better looks, in particular for short-term or singular events. In a digitized world, a look is represented as an image in a computer.

In particular, we focus on generative adversarial networks (GANs), a relatively new technique that has shown impressive results in purely data-driven modeling of images. “How do I look?” – this is a question typically asked when someone tries a new type of clothing or shoe. It emphasizes that visual appearance is key to fashion. The look of fashion can even be more important than fit and size: many people are willing to trade worse fit with better looks, in particular for short-term or singular events. In a digitized world, a look is represented as an image in a computer. The research focus and purpose of this project is to generate and manipulate images related to the fashion domain by using Machine Learning (ML). ML is a set of methods to learn from data and model high-dimensional probability distributions. Images with millions of pixels are a domain where these techniques are very useful. In addition to classical computer vision (e.g. face detection), ML is changing the way we interact using images with computers and smartphones. Style exploration can be such a novel application utilizing computer vision that fundamentally changes how we experience the fashion world. The methodology of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), on which our current line of research is focused, allows for learning arbitrary probability distributions and sampling from them. When we model images, the ability to generate samples from them gives rise to exciting new applications. An amazing example that gathered world-wide publicity recently allows to map motions from one human to another human and transfer pose. Many fashion applications of generative modeling require similar generation of human body poses conditioned on specific inputs — e.g. the swapping of clothes that people are wearing, or changing the body pose of a human image while keeping a plausible appearance. Our work also focuses on using state-of-the-art-image modelling techniques in order to flexibly modify the appearance of human fashion images. We recently published our work at the International Conference for Computer Vision (ICCV). A single fashion item (orange pullover) can be combined with multiple human models. This enables exploration of how it will look on different people. We’re constantly pushing the limit by advancing methodologies – and since the mentioned publication made significant progress towards better image quality. We’ll soon publish our latest approach – so watch our homepage if you want to know how this is achieved!;Swapping of Fashion on People Images with Generative Modelling

These photographs help our customers visualise the garments they browse and enhance their shopping experience. But what if our customers wish to visualise an individually created outfit? Zalando provides a large and evolving assortment of garments, which makes it infeasible to photograph every possible outfit combination. In order to circumvent this limitation, at Zalando Research, we work on a “Fashion Renderer”, which creates a computer-generated image of a fashion model wearing an input outfit for an input body pose as shown in the figure below. Note that the entire image, including the fashion model, is generated by our algorithm.;Fashion Renderer

Examples include the customer’s purchase history as well as their click chain through the product detail pages in the shop. Our aim is to build a method which takes the past of a time series as input and effectively forecasts future events – the task of a recommender system. In other words, we want to identify customer preferences (their “style”), and follow their changes through time. Such a method may have a big impact on personalizing the customer shopping experience, and we collaborate with Zalando’s recommendation team on that topic.;Forecasting the customer’s preference

Searching for similar-looking clothes? Drawing a sketch? Or creating a 3D representation on a computer program? Although all of them are viable solutions, they are quite time consuming. At Zalando, we target an agile design process that combines invaluable human experience with the power of Machine Learning (ML). In particular, we do research on novel ways to use generative models in fashion design for rapid visualizations and prototyping. One such ML model is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GAN is a deep learning architecture that learns the real data distribution in an adversarial setting. In our case, the real data correspond to the images of the articles in Zalando’s inventory. A GAN, which is trained on these images, can generate realistic-looking garment designs. In its original formulation, GANs only allow us to sample a generated image of a random article. However, in the context of fashion design, we want to control the clothing attributes, such as color, texture, and shape. In addition, it is desirable to disentangle the effects of these attributes, so that each aspect of the design can be independently manipulated as shown below:;Generative Fashion Design

Good modeling of textual data implies: Being able to differentiate proper language use from improper language use Being able to generate sensible and diverse samples from the language under study Useful applications of language modeling to downstream tasks such as predicting customer ratings from textual reviews (“sentiment analysis”) or locating mentions of fashion brands in a large corpus of text (“named-entity-recognition”). We consider a sentence such as “The dog is chasing the cat”. Standard language models model the likelihood of future words given already seen words (how likely is “cat” given “The dog is chasing”). Our approach goes further than this and also models the likelihood of future grammatical roles given past words and their grammatical roles. This is displayed at the top of the image — for instance it is very likely that a noun follows the verb phrase “is chasing”. Our project investigates to what extent this two-fold modeling improves the language understanding which can be derived from the model. Our experiments show that in certain cases this joint modeling can significantly improve the standard approach of only modeling the words by themselves. In doing so we use techniques based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling.;Syntax Aware Language Modeling using Recurrent Neural Networks (SALMs)

You may have an idea about the size you generally wear, but this piece of clothing perhaps comes in a different size system or maybe it is a style or category that you have not worn before. Then apart from your own preferences, there may be other factors (such as brand, design, material, manufacturing, etc.) that may as well come into play when determining the right size that would give you the best fit and feel. Zalando has a lot of customer order and purchase data that spans over a huge assortment of fashion articles.

As with the pupfish, when the world these policies live in changes, the policy’s performance quickly deteriorates. Yet for Reinforcement Learning to inform key functions at Zalando such as pricing, search and recommendations, it must be robust to changes in the world such as seasonal differences, missing data and shifts in user behavior. It must be robust like a camel, not fragile like the pupfish. To this end, we are researching provably robust policies: policies which perform well even in the face of unexpected conditions allowing us to show more relevant and inspiring products to our customers. So next time you’re surfing on the website and see a recommendation you like, don’t forget to thank the robust camel who made it happen.;Robust Reinforcement Learning
;Education & Research;;;1.0;;17.01.2021;We’re researching bounds on sample efficiency in simple, delayed reward settings, both minimax lower bounds for all methods and concrete upper bounds for popular methods. With these bounds in hand, we can understand the weaknesses in current methods and hopefully find new methods that get close to lower bounds.;0.0;;0.0;https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/sample-efficient-reinforcement-learning/;;Machine Learning;;['Fashion', 'RL', 'Research'];Reinforcement learning has seen many successes in the last years, enabling computers to beat human masters at such difficult tasks as Go and Atari games. In addition, reinforcement learning is showing great promise in creating exciting consumer facing technologies such as self driving cars, while also driving behind the scenes efficiency gains with self learning recommendation and pricing systems. Yet despite all these gains there are major challenges still out there. For one we have the issue of sample efficiency, the alphaGo computer had to play 5.4 * 10^9 games to train. Even if Jesus after his resurrection had set his mind to learning Go and played the game at an ungodly rate of 5 matches a minute ever since, he still wouldn’t have played as many games as the AlphaGo computer during training. So clearly state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods are able to beat human masters, they must play many more games than the human master practiced with. The Go master still beats the computer in sample efficiency. This issue becomes more pronounced when samples are expensive. One example is robot control: there a sample is obtained by letting the robot move around, which can take a few minutes to gather a sample. Clearly if we’re in the regime where 10^9 samples are required, the robot will probably not be trained before the four horsemen of the apocalypse show up and ruin the experiment. One reason sample efficiency is so difficult is because these are all delayed reward environments where the reward becomes apparent only after a bunch of interactions with the environment. With Q learning, it’s been shown that reward delay exponentially increases the time it takes to reduce the bias of the learned Q-function. In order to address this issue, many approaches craft an auxiliary reward structures for the agent. For example, in chess the agent can gain reward by capturing opposing pieces, lose if by having his pieces captured. In this way the agent learns the intermediate goal of capturing opposing pieces which is generally necessary to achieve the actual goal: checkmate. While the approach gets good results in specific domains, for every new domain the agent wishes to learn a new reward structure must be crafted by hand, and in many cases not enough knowledge exists about the domain to hand craft such a good reward structure. In addition, this puts an unnecessary upper limit on the performance of the whole system by introducing a target which is not aligned with the (generally unknown) best policy. Therefore, in order to better understand this problem we’re researching bounds on sample efficiency in simple, delayed reward settings, both minimax lower bounds for all methods and concrete upper bounds for popular methods. With these bounds in hand, we can understand the weaknesses in current methods and hopefully find new methods that get close to lower bounds.;Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning
