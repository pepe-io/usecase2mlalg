BCG Digital Ventures, in partnership with Sartorius, has launched LabTwin, the world’s first voice-powered lab assistant. LabTwin streamlines workflow and accelerates product timelines by allowing scientists to capture data, take notes and manage stock inventories simply by talking. BCGDV and Sartorius recognized the need for scientists to have their own purpose-built digital assistant, catering directly to their specific needs. We want LabTwin to become a seamless part of the scientific process, so we’re building features to correspond with what scientists need most in their everyday work: Voice-activated, hands-free documentation that’s reliable, scientifically accurate and easily integrated with their existing working routine. With LabTwin, scientists can take notes, create order lists, and set reminders or timers from anywhere in the lab. “At Sartorius we see firsthand the problems scientists face in the lab. They have to interrupt experiments to take notes, search for information, and check experimental conditions. LabTwin solves this gap by providing a voice-activated personal lab assistant that literally works alongside the scientist,” said Joachim Kreuzburg, CEO of Sartorius. LabTwin’s mobile app automatically synchronizes with its desktop app, so all voice notes taken in the lab can be quickly incorporated into written documentation. LabTwin makes collaboration with colleagues easy as multiple users can work on the same project. Instant updates mean collaborators always have the latest version, reducing errors in documentation. LabTwin can also handle supply lists, making day-to-day tasks more manageable. Data is kept safe and secure through tight regulatory compliance and data encryption. “Digital assistants will free employees up to work on the things that matter most. New forms of interactions such as voice or image recognition, in conjunction with machine learning technology, will push businesses further than ever before,” said Magdalena Paluch, LabTwin CEO, and co-founder. “LabTwin has the power to accelerate communication, unleash creativity and increase productivity by unshackling scientists from keyboards, desktops and hard-to-access folder structures. It’s the digital twin always within reach.” Powered by machine learning and voice recognition technologies, LabTwin is already streamlining workflows in laboratories around the world. Scientists from top-tier research institutes such as UCSF and Deutsches Primatenzentrum GmbH, along with top biopharma companies, have been quick to adopt LabTwin’s voice-powered assistant. LabTwin is a collaborative venture resulting from a shared interest in creating digital tools to empower scientists. To achieve this goal, LabTwin is open to exploring possible partnerships with other industry players and leading academic institutions. By using technology, we can aid scientific progress and enable scientists to work in new, liberating ways. With LabTwin, the time has come for scientists to reap the benefits of the digital assistant revolution.;LabTwin
