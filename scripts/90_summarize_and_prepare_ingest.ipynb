    "Winning the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic will require an effective vaccine that can be equitably and widely distributed. Building upon decades of research has allowed scientists to accelerate the search for a vaccine against COVID-19, but every day that goes by without a vaccine has enormous costs for the world nonetheless. We need new, fresh ideas from all corners of the world. Could online gaming and crowdsourcing help solve a worldwide pandemic? Pairing scientific and crowdsourced intelligence could help computational biochemists make measurable progress.\n",
    "mRNA vaccines have taken the lead as the fastest vaccine candidates for COVID-19, but currently, they face key potential limitations. One of the biggest challenges right now is how to design super stable messenger RNA molecules (mRNA). Conventional vaccines (like your seasonal flu shots) are packaged in disposable syringes and shipped under refrigeration around the world, but that is not currently possible for mRNA vaccines.\n",
    "Researchers have observed that RNA molecules have the tendency to spontaneously degrade. This is a serious limitation--a single cut can render the mRNA vaccine useless. Currently, little is known on the details of where in the backbone of a given RNA is most prone to being affected. Without this knowledge, current mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 must be prepared and shipped under intense refrigeration, and are unlikely to reach more than a tiny fraction of human beings on the planet unless they can be stabilized.\n",
    "The Eterna community, led by Professor Rhiju Das, a computational biochemist at Stanford’s School of Medicine, brings together scientists and gamers to solve puzzles and invent medicine. Eterna is an online video game platform that challenges players to solve scientific problems such as mRNA design through puzzles. The solutions are synthesized and experimentally tested at Stanford by researchers to gain new insights about RNA molecules. The Eterna community has previously unlocked new scientific principles, made new diagnostics against deadly diseases, and engaged the world’s most potent intellectual resources for the betterment of the public. The Eterna community has advanced biotechnology through its contribution in over 20 publications, including advances in RNA biotechnology.\n",
    "In this competition, we are looking to leverage the data science expertise of the Kaggle community to develop models and design rules for RNA degradation. Your model will predict likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule, trained on a subset of an Eterna dataset comprising over 3000 RNA molecules (which span a panoply of sequences and structures) and their degradation rates at each position. We will then score your models on a second generation of RNA sequences that have just been devised by Eterna players for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. These final test sequences are currently being synthesized and experimentally characterized at Stanford University in parallel to your modeling efforts -- Nature will score your models!\n",
    "Improving the stability of mRNA vaccines was a problem that was being explored before the pandemic but was expected to take many years to solve. Now, we must solve this deep scientific challenge in months, if not weeks, to accelerate mRNA vaccine research and deliver a refrigerator-stable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. The problem we are trying to solve has eluded academic labs, industry R&D groups, and supercomputers, and so we are turning to you. To help, you can join the team of video game players, scientists, and developers at Eterna to unlock the key in our fight against this devastating pandemic. \n",

      "   \"description\": \"BERT is a popular language model whose main pre-training task is to fill in the blank, i.e., predicting a word that was masked out of a sentence, based on the remaining words. In some applications, however, having an additional context can help the model make the right prediction, e.g., by taking the domain or the time of writing into account. This motivates us to advance the BERT architecture by adding a global state for conditioning on a fixed-sized context. We present our two novel approaches and apply them to an industry use-case, where we complete fashion outfits with missing articles, conditioned on a specific customer. An experimental comparison to other methods from the literature shows that our methods improve personalization significantly.\",\n",

We propose to employ visual data to infer size and fit characteristics of fashion articles. We introduce SizeNet, a weakly-supervised teacher-student training framework that leverages the power of statistical models combined with the rich visual information from article images to learn visual cues for size and fit characteristics, capable of tackling the challenging cold start problem.

Inspired by advances in attention and set-input machine learning, we present a novel architecture that can generate in one forward pass image collages of source templates using set-structured representations.

The eigenfunctions of these operators can be used to detect metastable sets, to project the dynamics onto the dominant slow processes, or to separate superimposed signals. We propose kernel transfer operators, which extend transfer operator theory to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and show that these operators are related to Hilbert space representations of conditional distributions, known as conditional mean embeddings. The proposed numerical methods to compute empirical estimates of these kernel transfer operators subsume existing data-driven methods for the approximation of transfer operators such as extended dynamic mode decomposition and its variants. One main benefit of the presented kernel-based approaches is that they can be applied to any domain where a similarity measure given by a kernel is available. Furthermore, we provide elementary results on eigendecompositions of finite-rank RKHS operators. We illustrate the results with the aid of guiding examples and highlight potential applications in molecular dynamics as well as video and text data analysis.\",\n",

      "   \"description\": \"Personalized size and fit recommendations bear crucial significance for any fashion e-commerce platform. Predicting the correct fit drives customer satisfaction and benefits the business by reducing costs incurred due to size-related returns. Traditional collaborative filtering algorithms seek to model customer preferences based on their previous orders. A typical challenge for such methods stems from extreme sparsity of customer-article orders. To alleviate this problem, we propose a deep learning based content-collaborative methodology for personalized size and fit recommendation. Our proposed method can ingest arbitrary customer and article data and can model multiple individuals or intents behind a single account. The method optimizes a global set of parameters to learn population-level abstractions of size and fit relevant information from observed customer-article interactions. It further employs customer and article specific embedding variables to learn their properties. Together with learned entity embeddings, the method maps additional customer and article attributes into a latent space to derive personalized recommendations. Application of our method to two publicly available datasets demonstrate an improvement over the state-of-the-art published results. On two proprietary datasets, one containing fit feedback from fashion experts and the other involving customer purchases, we further outperform comparable methodologies, including a recent Bayesian approach for size recommendation.\",\n",

      "   \"description\": \"In this work we propose a new neural network architecture that efficiently implements and learns general purpose set-equivariant functions. Such a function f maps a set of entities x = {x1, . . . , xn} from one domain to a set of same cardinality y = f (x) = {y1, . . . , yn} in another domain regardless of the ordering of the entities. The architecture is based on a gated recurrent network which is iteratively applied to all entities individually and at the same time syncs with the progression of the whole population. In reminiscence to this pattern, which can be frequently observed in nature, we call our approach SWARM mapping. Set-equivariant and generally permutation invariant functions are important building blocks for many state of the art machine learning approaches. Even in applications where the permutation invariance is not of primary interest, as to be seen in the recent success of attention based transformer models (Vaswani et. al. 2017). Accordingly, we demonstrate the power and usefulness of SWARM mappings in different applications. We compare the performance of our approach with another recently proposed set-equivariant function, the Set Transformer (Lee this http URL. 2018) and we demonstrate that models solely based on SWARM layers gives state of the art results.\",\n",

      "   \"description\": \"Deep Reinforcement Learning has been shown to be very successful in complex games, e.g. Atari or Go. These games have clearly defined rules, and hence allow simulation. In many practical applications, however, interactions with the environment are costly and a good simulator of the environment is not available. Further, as environments differ by application, the optimal inductive bias (architecture, hyperparameters, etc.) of a reinforcement agent depends on the application. In this work, we propose a multi-arm bandit framework that selects from a set of different reinforcement learning agents to choose the one with the best inductive bias. To alleviate the problem of sparse rewards, the reinforcement learning agents are augmented with surrogate rewards. This helps the bandit framework to select the best agents early, since these rewards are smoother and less sparse than the environment reward. The bandit has the double objective of maximizing the reward while the agents are learning and selecting the best agent after a finite number of learning steps. Our experimental results on standard environments show that the proposed framework is able to consistently select the optimal agent after a finite number of steps, while collecting more cumulative reward compared to selecting a sub-optimal architecture or uniformly alternating between different agents.\",\n",

      "   \"description\": \"Parametric generative deep models are state-of-the-art for photo and non-photo realistic image stylization. However, learning complicated image representations requires compute-intense models parametrized by a huge number of weights, which in turn requires large datasets to make learning successful. Non-parametric exemplar-based generation is a technique that works well to reproduce style from small datasets, but is also compute-intensive. These aspects are a drawback for the practice of digital AI artists: typically one wants to use a small set of stylization images, and needs a fast flexible model in order to experiment with it. With this motivation, our work has these contributions: (i) a novel stylization method called Fully Adversarial Mosaics (FAMOS) that combines the strengths of both parametric and non-parametric approaches; (ii) multiple ablations and image examples that analyze the method and show its capabilities; (iii) source code that will empower artists and machine learning researchers to use and modify FAMOS.\",\n",

      "   \"description\": \"GANs excel at learning high dimensional distributions, but they can update generator parameters in directions that do not correspond to the steepest descent direction of the objective. Prominent examples of problematic update directions include those used in both Goodfellow's original GAN and the WGAN-GP. To formally describe an optimal update direction, we introduce a theoretical framework which allows the derivation of requirements on both the divergence and corresponding method for determining an update direction, with these requirements guaranteeing unbiased mini-batch updates in the direction of steepest descent. We propose a novel divergence which approximates the Wasserstein distance while regularizing the critic's first order information. Together with an accompanying update direction, this divergence fulfills the requirements for unbiased steepest descent updates. We verify our method, the First Order GAN, with image generation on CelebA, LSUN and CIFAR-10 and set a new state of the art on the One Billion Word language generation task.

In this paper, we argue this deprives the LM of crucial syntactic signals that can be detected at high confidence using existing parsers. We present a simple but highly effective approach for training neural LMs using both lexical and syntactic information, and a novel approach for applying such LMs to unparsed text using sequential Monte Carlo sampling. In experiments on a range of corpora and corpus sizes, we show our approach consistently outperforms standard lexical LMs in character-level language modeling; on the other hand, for word-level models the models are on a par with standard language models. These results indicate potential for expanding LMs beyond lexical surface features to higher-level NLP features for character-level models.\",\n",

Such images are ubiquitous on the web and in fashion blogs, and are typically studio photos, we refer to this setting as studio-to-shop. Recent advances in computational fashion include the development of domain-specific numerical representations.

This fully convolutional model generates smooth (without any visible borders) mosaic images which morph and blend different textures locally.

      "   \"description\": \"We present a novel method to solve image analogy problems : it allows to learn the relation between paired images present in training data, and then generalize and generate images that correspond to the relation, but were never seen in the training set. Therefore, we call the method Conditional Analogy Generative Adversarial Network (CAGAN), as it is based on adversarial training and employs deep convolutional neural networks. An especially interesting application of that technique is automatic swapping of clothing on fashion model photos. Our work has the following contributions. First, the definition of the end-to-end trainable CAGAN architecture, which implicitly learns segmentation masks without expensive supervised labeling data. Second, experimental results show plausible segmentation masks and often convincing swapped images, given the target article. Finally, we discuss the next steps for that technique: neural network architecture improvements and more advanced applications.\",\n",

      "   \"description\": \"Crowdsourcing has proven to be an effective method for generating labeled data for a range of NLP tasks. However, multiple recent attempts of using crowdsourcing to generate gold-labeled training data for semantic role labeling (SRL) reported only modest results, indicating that SRL is perhaps too difficult a task to be effectively crowdsourced. In this paper, we postulate that while producing SRL annotation does require expert involvement in general, a large subset of SRL labeling tasks is in fact appropriate for the crowd. We present a novel workflow in which we employ a classifier to identify difficult annotation tasks and route each task either to experts or crowd workers according to their difficulties. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach reduces the workload for experts by over two-thirds, and thus significantly reduces the cost of producing SRL annotation at little loss in quality.\",\n",

The PSGAN has several novel abilities which surpass the current state of the art in texture synthesis. First, we can learn multiple textures, periodic or non-periodic, from datasets of one or more complex large images. Second, we show that the image generation with PSGANs has properties of a texture manifold: we can smoothly interpolate between samples in the structured noise space and generate novel samples, which lie perceptually between the textures of the original dataset. We make multiple experiments which show that PSGANs can flexibly handle diverse texture and image data sources, and the method is highly scalable and can generate output images of arbitrary large size.\",\n",

      "   \"description\": \"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a recent approach to train generative models of data, which have been shown to work particularly well on image data. In the current paper we introduce a new model for texture synthesis based on GAN learning. By extending the input noise distribution space from a single vector to a whole spatial tensor, we create an architecture with properties well suited to the task of texture synthesis, which we call spatial GAN (SGAN). To our knowledge, this is the first successful completely data-driven texture synthesis method based on GANs. Our method has the following features which make it a state of the art algorithm for texture synthesis: high image quality of the generated textures, very high scalability w.r.t. the output texture size, fast real-time forward generation, the ability to fuse multiple diverse source images in complex textures. To illustrate these capabilities we present multiple experiments with different classes of texture images and use cases. We also discuss some limitations of our method with respect to the types of texture images it can synthesize, and compare it to other neural techniques for texture generation.\",\n",

      "   \"description\": \"We present a method to determine Fashion DNA, coordinate vectors locating fashion items in an abstract space. Our approach is based on a deep neural network architecture that ingests curated article information such as tags and images, and is trained to predict sales for a large set of frequent customers. In the process, a dual space of customer style preferences naturally arises. Interpretation of the metric of these spaces is straightforward: The product of Fashion DNA and customer style vectors yields the forecast purchase likelihood for the customer-item pair, while the angle between Fashion DNA vectors is a measure of item similarity. Importantly, our models are able to generate unbiased purchase probabilities for fashion items based solely on article information, even in absence of sales data, thus circumventing the \\\"cold-start problem\\\" of collaborative recommendation approaches. Likewise, it generalizes easily and reliably to customers outside the training set. We experiment with Fashion DNA models based on visual and/or tag item data, evaluate their recommendation power, and discuss the resulting article similarities.\",\n",
